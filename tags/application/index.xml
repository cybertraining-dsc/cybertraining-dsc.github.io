&lt;p>This section covers 51 values of X and an overall study of Big data that
emerged from a NIST (National Institute for Standards and Technology)
study of Big data. The section covers the NIST Big Data Public Working
Group (NBD-PWG) Process and summarizes the work of five subgroups:
Definitions and Taxonomies Subgroup, Reference Architecture Subgroup,
Security and Privacy Subgroup, Technology Roadmap Subgroup and the
Requirements andUse Case Subgroup. 51 use cases collected in this
process are briefly discussed with a classification of the source of
parallelism and the high and low level computational structure. We
describe the key features of this classification.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="introduction-to-nist-big-data-public-working">Introduction to NIST Big Data Public Working&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The focus of the (NBD-PWG) is to form a community of interest from
industry, academia, and government, with the goal of developing a
consensus definitions, taxonomies, secure reference architectures, and
technology roadmap. The aim is to create vendor-neutral, technology and
infrastructure agnostic deliverables to enable big data stakeholders to
pick-and-choose best analytics tools for their processing and
visualization requirements on the most suitable computing platforms and
clusters while allowing value-added from big data service providers and
flow of data between the stakeholders in a cohesive and secure manner.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="definitions-and-taxonomies-subgroup">Definitions and Taxonomies Subgroup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The focus is to gain a better understanding of the principles of Big
Data. It is important to develop a consensus-based common language and
vocabulary terms used in Big Data across stakeholders from industry,
academia, and government. In addition, it is also critical to identify
essential actors with roles and responsibility, and subdivide them into
components and sub-components on how they interact/ relate with each
other according to their similarities and differences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Definitions: Compile terms used from all stakeholders regarding the
meaning of Big Data from various standard bodies, domain applications,
and diversified operational environments. For Taxonomies: Identify key
actors with their roles and responsibilities from all stakeholders,
categorize them into components and subcomponents based on their
similarities and differences. In particular data Science and Big Data
terms are discussed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus-based approach
to orchestrate vendor-neutral, technology and infrastructure agnostic
for analytics tools and computing environments. The goal is to enable
Big Data stakeholders to pick-and-choose technology-agnostic analytics
tools for processing and visualization in any computing platform and
cluster while allowing value-added from Big Data service providers and
the flow of the data between the stakeholders in a cohesive and secure
manner. Results include a reference architecture with well defined
components and linkage as well as several exemplars.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="security-and-privacy-subgroup">Security and Privacy Subgroup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus secure reference
architecture to handle security and privacy issues across all
stakeholders. This includes gaining an understanding of what standards
are available or under development, as well as identifies which key
organizations are working on these standards. The Top Ten Big Data
Security and Privacy Challenges from the CSA (Cloud Security Alliance)
BDWG are studied. Specialized use cases include Retail/Marketing, Modern
Day Consumerism, Nielsen Homescan, Web Traffic Analysis, Healthcare,
Health Information Exchange, Genetic Privacy, Pharma Clinical Trial Data
Sharing, Cyber-security, Government, Military and Education.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="technology-roadmap-subgroup">Technology Roadmap Subgroup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus vision with
recommendations on how Big Data should move forward by performing a good
gap analysis through the materials gathered from all other NBD
subgroups. This includes setting standardization and adoption priorities
through an understanding of what standards are available or under
development as part of the recommendations. Tasks are gather input from
NBD subgroups and study the taxonomies for the actors' roles and
responsibility, use cases and requirements, and secure reference
architecture; gain understanding of what standards are available or
under development for Big Data; perform a thorough gap analysis and
document the findings; identify what possible barriers may delay or
prevent adoption of Big Data; and document vision and recommendations.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="interfaces-subgroup">Interfaces Subgroup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This subgroup is working on the following document: &lt;em>NIST Big Data
Interoperability Framework: Volume 8, Reference Architecture Interface&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This document summarizes interfaces that are instrumental for the
interaction with Clouds, Containers, and HPC systems to manage virtual
clusters to support the NIST Big Data Reference Architecture (NBDRA).
The Representational State Transfer (REST) paradigm is used to define
these interfaces allowing easy integration and adoption by a wide
variety of frameworks. . This volume, Volume 8, uses the work performed
by the NBD-PWG to identify objects instrumental for the NIST Big Data
Reference Architecture (NBDRA) which is introduced in the NBDIF: Volume
6, Reference Architecture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This presentation was given at the &lt;em>2nd NIST Big Data Public Working
Group (NBD-PWG) Workshop&lt;/em> in Washington DC in June 2017. It explains our
thoughts on deriving automatically a reference architecture form the
Reference Architecture Interface specifications directly from the
document.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus list of Big Data
requirements across all stakeholders. This includes gathering and
understanding various use cases from diversified application
domains.Tasks are gather use case input from all stakeholders; derive
Big Data requirements from each use case; analyze/prioritize a list of
challenging general requirements that may delay or prevent adoption of
Big Data deployment; develop a set of general patterns capturing the
&lt;em>essence&lt;/em> of use cases (not done yet) and work with Reference
Architecture to validate requirements and reference architecture by
explicitly implementing some patterns based on use cases. The progress
of gathering use cases (discussed in next two units) and requirements
systemization are discussed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Recommender systems operate under the hood of such widely recognized
sites as Amazon, eBay, Monster and Netflix where everything is a
recommendation. This involves a symbiotic relationship between vendor
and buyer whereby the buyer provides the vendor with information about
their preferences, while the vendor then offers recommendations tailored
to match their needs. Kaggle competitions h improve the success of the
Netflix and other recommender systems. Attention is paid to models that
are used to compare how changes to the systems affect their overall
performance. It is interesting that the humble ranking has become such a
dominant driver of the world&amp;rsquo;s economy. More examples of recommender
systems are given from Google News, Retail stores and in depth Yahoo!
covering the multi-faceted criteria used in deciding recommendations on
web sites.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The formulation of recommendations in terms of points in a space or bag
is given where bags of item properties, user properties, rankings and
users are useful. Detail is given on basic principles behind recommender
systems: user-based collaborative filtering, which uses similarities in
user rankings to predict their interests, and the Pearson correlation,
used to statistically quantify correlations between users viewed as
points in a space of items. Items are viewed as points in a space of
users in item-based collaborative filtering. The Cosine Similarity is
introduced, the difference between implicit and explicit ratings and the
k Nearest Neighbors algorithm. General features like the curse of
dimensionality in high dimensions are discussed. A simple Python k
Nearest Neighbor code and its application to an artificial data set in 3
dimensions is given. Results are visualized in Matplotlib in 2D and with
Plotviz in 3D. The concept of a training and a testing set are
introduced with training set pre labeled. Recommender system are used to
discuss clustering with k-means based clustering methods used and their
results examined in Plotviz. The original labelling is compared to
clustering results and extension to 28 clusters given. General issues in
clustering are discussed including local optima, the use of annealing to
avoid this and value of heuristic algorithms.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="s-recommender">Recommender Systems&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We introduce Recommender systems as an optimization technology used in a
variety of applications and contexts online. They operate in the
background of such widely recognized sites as Amazon, eBay, Monster and
Netflix where everything is a recommendation. This involves a symbiotic
relationship between vendor and buyer whereby the buyer provides the
vendor with information about their preferences, while the vendor then
offers recommendations tailored to match their needs, to the benefit of
both.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There follows an exploration of the Kaggle competition site, other
recommender systems and Netflix, as well as competitions held to improve
the success of the Netflix recommender system. Finally attention is paid
to models that are used to compare how changes to the systems affect
their overall performance. It is interesting how the humble ranking has
become such a dominant driver of the world&amp;rsquo;s economy.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="recommender-systems-as-an-optimization-problem">Recommender Systems as an Optimization Problem&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We define a set of general recommender systems as matching of items to
people or perhaps collections of items to collections of people where
items can be other people, products in a store, movies, jobs, events,
web pages etc. We present this as &amp;ldquo;yet another optimization problem&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="recommender-systems-introduction">Recommender Systems Introduction&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We give a general discussion of recommender systems and point out that
they are particularly valuable in long tail of tems (to be recommended)
that are not commonly known. We pose them as a rating system and relate
them to information retrieval rating systems. We can contrast
recommender systems based on user profile and context; the most familiar
collaborative filtering of others ranking; item properties; knowledge
and hybrid cases mixing some or all of these.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We summarize some interesting points from a tutorial from Netflix for
whom &lt;em>everything is a recommendation&lt;/em>. Rankings are given in multiple
categories and categories that reflect user interests are especially
important. Criteria used include explicit user preferences, implicit
based on ratings and hybrid methods as well as freshness and diversity.
Netflix tries to explain the rationale of its recommendations. We give
some data on Netflix operations and some methods used in its recommender
systems. We describe the famous Netflix Kaggle competition to improve
its rating system. The analogy to maximizing click through rate is given
and the objectives of optimization are given.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Next we go through Netflix&amp;rsquo;s methodology in letting data speak for
itself in optimizing the recommender engine. An example iis given on
choosing self produced movies. A/B testing is discussed with examples
showing how testing does allow optimizing of sophisticated criteria.
This lesson is concluded by comments on Netflix technology and the full
spectrum of issues that are involved including user interface, data, AB
testing, systems and architectures. We comment on optimizing for a
household rather than optimizing for individuals in household.&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="recommender-systems-in-yahoo-use-case-example">Recommender Systems in Yahoo Use Case Example&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>We describe in greatest detail the methods used to optimize Yahoo web
sites. There are two lessons discussing general approach and a third
lesson examines a particular personalized Yahoo page with its different
components. We point out the different criteria that must be blended in
making decisions; these criteria include analysis of what user does
after a particular page is clicked; is the user satisfied and cannot
that we quantified by purchase decisions etc. We need to choose
Articles, ads, modules, movies, users, updates, etc to optimize metrics
such as relevance score, CTR, revenue, engagement.These lesson stress
that if though we have big data, the recommender data is sparse. We
discuss the approach that involves both batch (offline) and on-line
(real time) components.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Collaborative filtering is a core approach to recommender systems. There
is user-based and item-based collaborative filtering and here we discuss
the user-based case. Here similarities in user rankings allow one to
predict their interests, and typically this quantified by the Pearson
correlation, used to statistically quantify correlations between users.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="item-based-collaborative-filtering-and-its-technologies">Item-based Collaborative Filtering and its Technologies&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We move on to item-based collaborative filtering where items are viewed
as points in a space of users. The Cosine Similarity is introduced, the
difference between implicit and explicit ratings and the k Nearest
Neighbors algorithm. General features like the curse of dimensionality
in high dimensions are discussed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We covered user-based collaborative filtering in the previous unit. Here
we start by discussing memory-based real time and model based offline
(batch) approaches. Now we look at item-based collaborative filtering
where items are viewed in the space of users and the cosine measure is
used to quantify distances. WE discuss optimizations and how batch
processing can help. We discuss different Likert ranking scales and
issues with new items that do not have a significant number of rankings.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We define the k Nearest Neighbor algorithms and present the Python

there would be faster solution methods.&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="recommender-systems---k-neighbors">Recommender Systems - K-Neighbors&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Next we provide some sample Python code for the k Nearest Neighbor and its application to
an artificial data set in 3 dimensions. Results are visualized in
Matplotlib in 2D and with Plotviz in 3D. The concept of training and
testing sets are introduced with training set pre-labelled.
This lesson is adapted from the Python k Nearest Neighbor code found on the
web associated with a book by Harrington on Machine Learning [??]. There are
two data sets. First we consider a set of 4 2D vectors divided into two
categories (clusters) and use k=3 Nearest Neighbor algorithm to classify
3 test points. Second we consider a 3D dataset that has already been
classified and show how to normalize. In this lesson we just use
Matplotlib to give 2D plots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The lesson goes through an example of using k NN classification
algorithm by dividing dataset into 2 subsets. One is training set with
initial classification; the other is test point to be classified by k=3
NN using training set. The code records fraction of points with a
different classification from that input. One can experiment with
different sizes of the two subsets. The Python implementation of
algorithm is analyzed in detail.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="plotviz">Plotviz&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The clustering methods are used and their results examined in
Plotviz. The original labelling is compared to clustering results and
extension to 28 clusters given. General issues in clustering are
discussed including local optima, the use of annealing to avoid this
and value of heuristic algorithms.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This section starts by describing the LHC accelerator at CERN and
evidence found by the experiments suggesting existence of a Higgs Boson.
The huge number of authors on a paper, remarks on histograms and Feynman
diagrams is followed by an accelerator picture gallery. The next unit is
devoted to Python experiments looking at histograms of Higgs Boson
production with various forms of shape of signal and various background
and with various event totals. Then random variables and some simple
principles of statistics are introduced with explanation as to why they
are relevant to Physics counting experiments. The unit introduces
Gaussian (normal) distributions and explains why they seen so often in
natural phenomena. Several Python illustrations are given. Random
Numbers with their Generators and Seeds lead to a discussion of Binomial
and Poisson Distribution. Monte-Carlo and accept-reject methods. The
Central Limit Theorem concludes discussion.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The changing global climate is suspected to have long-term effects on
much of the world&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants. Among the various effects, the rising
sea level will directly affect many people living in low-lying coastal
regions. While the ocean-s thermal expansion has been the dominant
contributor to rises in sea level, the potential contribution of
discharges from the polar ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica may
provide a more significant threat due to the unpredictable response to
the changing climate. The Radar-Informatics unit provides a glimpse in
the processes fueling global climate change and explains what methods
are used for ice data acquisitions and analysis.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This lesson motivates radar-informatics by building on previous
discussions on why X-applications are growing in data size and why
analytics are necessary for acquiring knowledge from large data. The
lesson details three mosaics of a changing Greenland ice sheet and
provides a concise overview to subsequent lessons by detailing
explaining how other remote sensing technologies, such as the radar, can
be used to sound the polar ice sheets and what we are doing with radar
images to extract knowledge to be incorporated into numerical models.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We start with the Internet of Things IoT giving examples like monitors
of machine operation, QR codes, surveillance cameras, scientific
sensors, drones and self driving cars and more generally transportation
systems. We give examples of robots and drones. We introduce the
Industrial Internet of Things IIoT and summarize surveys and
expectations Industry wide. We give examples from General Electric.
Sensor clouds control the many small distributed devices of IoT and
IIoT. More detail is given for radar data gathered by sensors;
ubiquitous or smart cities and homes including U-Korea; and finally the
smart electric grid.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sports sees significant growth in analytics with pervasive statistics
shifting to more sophisticated measures. We start with baseball as game
is built around segments dominated by individuals where detailed
(video/image) achievement measures including PITCHf/x and FIELDf/x are
moving field into big data arena. There are interesting relationships
between the economics of sports and big data analytics. We look at
Wearables and consumer sports/recreation. The importance of spatial
visualization is discussed. We look at other Sports: Soccer, Olympics,
NFL Football, Basketball, Tennis and Horse Racing.&lt;/p>

most baseball action is built around individuals often interacting in
pairs. This is much easier to quantify than many player phenomena in
other sports. We discuss Performance-Dollar relationship including new
stadiums and media/advertising. We look at classic baseball averages and
sophisticated measures like Wins Above Replacement.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This section starts with an overview of data mining and puts our study
of classification, clustering and exploration methods in context. We
examine the problem to be solved in web and text search and note the
relevance of history with libraries, catalogs and concordances. An
overview of web search is given describing the continued evolution of
search engines and the relation to the field of Information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The importance of recall, precision and diversity is discussed. The
important Bag of Words model is introduced and both Boolean queries and
the more general fuzzy indices. The important vector space model and
revisiting the Cosine Similarity as a distance in this bag follows. The
basic TF-IDF approach is dis cussed. Relevance is discussed with a
probabilistic model while the distinction between Bayesian and frequency
views of probability distribution completes this unit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We start with an overview of the different steps (data analytics) in web
search and then goes key steps in detail starting with document
preparation. An inverted index is described and then how it is prepared
for web search. The Boolean and Vector Space approach to query
processing follow. This is followed by Link Structure Analysis including
Hubs, Authorities and PageRank. The application of PageRank ideas as
reputation outside web search is covered. The web graph structure,
crawling it and issues in web advertising and search follow. The use of
clustering and topic models completes the section.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="web-search-and-text-mining">Web Search and Text Mining&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The unit starts with the web with its size, shape (coming from the
mutual linkage of pages by URL&amp;rsquo;s) and universal power laws for number of
pages with particular number of URL&amp;rsquo;s linking out or in to page.
Information retrieval is introduced and compared to web search. A
comparison is given between semantic searches as in databases and the
full text search that is base of Web search. The origin of web search in
libraries, catalogs and concordances is summarized. DIKW &amp;ndash; Data
Information Knowledge Wisdom &amp;ndash; model for web search is discussed. Then
features of documents, collections and the important Bag of Words
representation. Queries are presented in context of an Information
Retrieval architecture. The method of judging quality of results
including recall, precision and diversity is described. A time line for
evolution of search engines is given.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Boolean and Vector Space models for query including the cosine
similarity are introduced. Web Crawlers are discussed and then the steps
needed to analyze data from Web and produce a set of terms. Building and
accessing an inverted index is followed by the importance of term
specificity and how it is captured in TF-IDF. We note how frequencies
are converted into belief and relevance.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This short lesson describes the different steps needed in web search
including: Get the digital data (from web or from scanning); Crawl web;
Preprocess data to get searchable things (words, positions); Form
Inverted Index mapping words to documents; Rank relevance of documents

&lt;p>The value of links and the concepts of Hubs and Authorities are
discussed. This leads to definition of PageRank with examples.
Extensions of PageRank viewed as a reputation are discussed with journal
rankings and university department rankings as examples. There are many
extension of these ideas which are not discussed here although topic
models are covered briefly in a later lesson.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Internet and mobile advertising is growing fast and can be personalized
more than for traditional media. There are several advertising types
Sponsored search, Contextual ads, Display ads and different models: Cost
per viewing, cost per clicking and cost per action. This leads to
emerging field of computational advertising.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We discuss briefly approaches to defining groups of documents. We
illustrate this for Google News and give an example that this can give
different answers from word-based analyses. We mention some work at
Indiana University on a Latent Semantic Indexing model.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The zoom will be &lt;a href="https://iu.zoom.us/my/gc.fox">https://iu.zoom.us/my/gc.fox&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will discuss how to interact with us. We can adjust the course
somewhat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also as lectures are/will be put on YouTube, we will go to one lecture per week &amp;ndash; we will choose day&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Syllabus has a general course description&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please communicate initially by email &lt;a href="mailto:gcf@iu.edu">gcf@iu.edu&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This first class discussed structure of class and agreed to have a section on deep learning technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We gave &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1esj3zXCswQm5n8kfF-BvRH2Ih6oqNpPQjq02UPzvIB0/edit?usp=sharing">Introductory Lecture&lt;/a>

&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Industry being transformed by a) Autonomy (AI) and b) Electric power&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Established Organizations can’t change
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>General Motors (employees: 225,000 in 2016 to around 180,000 in 2018) finds it hard to compete with Tesla (42000 employees)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Market value GM was half the market value of Tesla at the start of 2020 but is now just 11% October 2020&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GM purchased Cruise to compete&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Funding and then buying startups is an important “transformation” strategy&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Autonomy needs Sensors Computers Algorithms and Software
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Also experience (training data)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Algorithms main bottleneck; others will automatically improve although lots of interesting work in new sensors, computers and software&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Over the last 3 years, electrical power has gone from interesting to “bound to happen”; Tesla’s happy customers probably contribute to this&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Batteries and Charging stations needed&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;h2 id="transportation-systems-summary">Transportation Systems Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The ride-hailing industry highlights the growth of a new “Transportation System” TS
a. For ride-hailing TS controls rides matching drivers and customers; it predicts how to position cars and how to avoid traffic slowdowns
b. However, TS is much bigger outside ride-hailing as we move into the “connected vehicle” era
c. TS will probably find autonomous vehicles easier to deal with than human drivers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cloud Fog and Edge components&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Autonomous AI was centered on generalized image processing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>TS also needs AI (and DL) but this is for routing and geospatial time-series; different technologies from those for image processing&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
