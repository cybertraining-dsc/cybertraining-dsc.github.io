&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this report is to highlight how the inception of big data in baseball has changed the way baseball is played and how it affects the choices managers make before, during, and after a game. It was found that big data analytics can allow baseball teams to make more sound and intelligent decisions when making calls during games and signing contracts with free agent and rookie players. The significance of this project and what was found was that teams that adopt the &lt;em&gt;moneyball mentality&lt;/em&gt; would be able to perform at much higher levels than before with a much lower budget than other teams. The main conclusion from the report was that the use of data analytics in baseball is a fairly new idea, but if implemented on a larger scale than only a couple of teams, it could greatly change the way baseball is played from a managerial standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords:&lt;/strong&gt; sports, data analysis, baseball, performance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction&#34;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever people talk about sports, they will always talk about some kind of statistic to show that their team is performing well, or certain player(s) are playing incredibly well. This is due to the fact that statistics has become extremely important in sports, especially in rating an entity’s performance. While essentially every sport has adopted statistics to quantify performance, baseball is the most well-known sport to use it, due to the obscene number of stats that are tracked for each player and team, as well as the sport that uses stats the most in how they play the game. The MLB publishes about 85 different statistics for individual players, including the stats tracked of the teams, there is likely to be about double the amount if tracked statistics for the sport of baseball. The way that all the statistics are calculated, is, of course, by analyzing big data found from the players and teams. This report will mainly talk about the history of big data and data analytics in baseball, what the data is tracking, what we can learn from the data, and how the data is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-dataset&#34;&gt;2. Dataset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dataset that will be analyzed in this report will be the Lahmen Sabermetrics dataset. This dataset is a large dataset curated by Sean Lahmen, which contains baseball data starting from the year 1871, which is when the Major League Baseball association was founded &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The dataset contains data for many different types of statistics, including batting stats, fielding stats, pitching stats, awards stats, player salaries, and games they played in. The data for this dataset has statistics from the last season that occurred (2020 season), but the data that could be accessed for this report is from 1871-2015. I plan to use this dataset for discussing later how the data in sets like this is used for statistical analysis in baseball and how teams can use this to their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-background&#34;&gt;3. Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of baseball has been a sport that has existed for centuries, but the actual sport called baseball started in early to mid 1800s. Baseball became popularized in the United States in the 1850s, where a baseball craze hit the New York area, and baseball quickly was named a &lt;em&gt;national pastime.&lt;/em&gt; The first professional baseball team was the Cincinnati Red Stockings, which was established in 1869, and the first professional league was established in 1871, and was called the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players. This league only lasted a few years and was replaced by a more formally structured league called the National League in 1876, and the American League was established in 1901 from the Western League. A vast majority of the modern rules of baseball were in place by 1893, and the last major change was instituted in 1901 where foul balls are counted as strikes. The World Series was inaugurated in the fall of 1903, where the champion of the National League would play against the champion of the American League. During this time, there were many problems with the league, such as strikes due to poor and unequal pay and the discrimination of African Americans. The era in the time of the early 1900s was the first era of baseball, and the second era of baseball started in the 1920s where a plethora of changes to the game caused the sport to move from more of a &lt;em&gt;pitcher’s game&lt;/em&gt; to a &lt;em&gt;hitter’s game,&lt;/em&gt; which was emphasized by the success of the first &lt;em&gt;power hitter&lt;/em&gt; in professional baseball, Babe Ruth. In the 1960s, baseball was losing revenue due to the rising popularity of football, the league had to make changes to combat this drop in revenue and popularity. The changes lead to the salaries of the players getting increased and also an increase in attendance to games, which means increased revenue &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big data is able to be used in baseball through the use of statistics, which has become a major part in how the sport is played. The use of statistics in baseball has become known as sabermetrics, which can be used by teams to make calls for the game based on numbers. The idea of using sabermetrics started from the book called &lt;em&gt;Moneyball&lt;/em&gt;. The book was published in 2003, and was about the Oakland Athletics baseball team and how they were able to use sabermetric analysis to compete on equal grounds with teams that had much more money and good players than the A&amp;rsquo;s team &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This book has had a major impact on the way baseball is played today for several teams. For example, teams like the New York Yankees, the St. Louis Cardinals, and the Boston Red Sox have hired full-time sabermetric analysts in attempts to gain an edge over other teams by using these sabermetrics to influence their decisions. Also, the Tampa Bay Rays were able to make the &lt;em&gt;moneyball&lt;/em&gt; idea a reality by making it to the 2020 World Series with a much lower budget team and using lots of sabermetrics in their decision-making &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This &lt;em&gt;moneyball strategy&lt;/em&gt; is not the perfect strategy however, because the Rays lost the World Series, and the turning point for their loss could be pointed to a decision they made based on what the analytics said they should do, which ended up being the wrong choice, which lost them a crucial game in the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-big-data-in-baseball&#34;&gt;4. Big Data in Baseball&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data that is being analyzed for the statistics in baseball are datasets similar to the one this report is looking into, the Lahmen Sabermetrics dataset. Since this dataset contains a vast amount of data for each player and many different tables containing many different kinds of data, many kinds of statistics are able to be tracked for each player. With this large amount of statistics, teams are able to look to numbers and analytics in order to make the best decision on the actions to make during a game. Teams can also use analytic technology to predict the performance of a player based on their previous accomplishments and comparing that to similar players and situations in the past &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of analysis can be used to gauge the potential performance of a free-agent or rookie player, as well as deciding what player should be in the starting lineup for the upcoming game(s). Since these sabermetric analyses are able to predict the performance of a player in the coming years, they are able to tell if a contract made by a team is likely to not be a smart deal since they tend to make long-term deals for lots of money, even though it is likely that the player will not continue to perform at the same level they are currently at for the entirety of their contract. This is normally due to the inability to play at an incredibly high level consistently for a long period of time and regression of performance from age, which is shown to start occuring at around 32 years old &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This simply means that large contracts have a trend of being a large loss of money in the long run shown from analysis of similar types of contracts in the past. This kind of analysis also allows for a players ranking to be deciding by more areas than before. For example, a player&amp;rsquo;s offensive capabilities can be shown by looking at more categories than the amount of home runs hit and batting average, they can also look at baserunning skill, slugging percentage, and overall baseball intelligence. This ability of looking at a player&amp;rsquo;s overall capabilities in a more analytical manner allows teams to not throw all their budget into one or two top prospected players, but can spread their money across several talented players to have a good and balanced team. Another reason why deciding to not spend lots of money on a long contract for a top prospected player is that the analysis shows that players have started to have shorter lengths of time where they are able to perform at their best, even though other sports have seen the opposite in recent years . However, young players have been performing at a much higher level in recent years and they have had younger players moving from the minor to the major league much faster than before &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data that is presented in the Lahman Sabermetrics database and other similar databases is able to allow analysts to compare data and statistics of one team with any/every other team with relative ease and in an easy to understand way. For example, the comparative analysis Figure 1 below shows that the payroll of teams and their winning percentage, analysts are able to learn that the New York Yankees have a much higher payroll than all other teams and they have a very good win rate, but there are other teams that do have very high payrolls and have the same good rate rate. Also, Figure 1 shows that there are other teams that have higher payrolls than average, but have a very bad win rate compared to all other teams, including teams that have a much lower payroll &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This kind of analysis shows us that spending lots of money does not guarantee a strong season, which can strengthen the idea of the &lt;em&gt;moneyball strategy&lt;/em&gt; coined earlier where teams attempt to waste less money by spreading budgets across several players other than spending most of the budget on only one or two players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Comparative Analysis of Payroll to Win Percentage &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-328/raw/main/report/images/spending_graph.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Comparative Analysis of Payroll to Win Percentage Graph&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is only one way that the Lahman Sabermetrics dataset can be used, but there are many more ways this data can be used to make league wide analyses and compare a certain team to others. This can be used by teams to possibly learn what they might be doing wrong if they feel as though they should be performing better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-conclusion&#34;&gt;5. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report discusses the history of baseball and how big data analytics came to be prevalent in the sport, as well as how big data is used in baseball and what can be learned from the use of it so far. Big data is able to be used to make decisions that could greatly benefit a team from saving money on a contract with a player to making a choice during a game. Big data analytics use in baseball is a fairly new occurrence, but due to the advantages a team can gain from using analytics, it is likely that use of it will increase soon in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of this review is how big data analysis is used in a predictive model for classifying what pitches are going to be thrown next. Baseball is a pitcher’s game, as they can control the tempo. Pitchers have to decide what type of pitch they want to throw to the batter based on how their statistics compare to that of the batters. They need to know what the batter struggles to hit against, and where in the strike zone they struggle the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of technology into sports, data scientists are sliding headfirst into Major League Baseball. And with the introduction of Statcast in 2015, The MLB has been looking at different ways to use technology in the game. In 2020 alone, the MLB introduce several different types of technologies to keep the fans engaged with the games while not being able to attend them [^3]. In this paper, we will be exploring a predictive model to determine pitches thrown by each pitcher in the MLB. We will be reviewing several predictive models to understand how this can be done with the use of big data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big data is everywhere and has been used in sports for years. Especially in Major League Baseball, where big data has been analyzed for various things. For example, in the movie Moneyball (which is based on true events), the general manager of the Oakland A’s uses analytics to find players that will win them games that other teams overlook. They used many different statistics; batting average, batting average with runners on base, fielding percentage, etc., to find these players. Not only do teams use big data to find the right players for them, but the MLB also uses it for their Statcast technology. Statcast was implemented in 2015 and is an automated tool that analyzes data to deliver accurate statistics in real time &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This technology tracks many different aspects of the game, including many different pitching statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pitching statistics that are recording is actually through the PITCHf/x system &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This system was implemented nine years before Statcast. The system is made up of three cameras that are located throughout the stadium that measure the speed, spin, and trajectory of the baseball as it is thrown. Statcast adopted this technology as the MLB was looking at ways to track more than just pitching statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while there is a lot of data about pitching, we will only be focusing on release speed, release spin, pitch type, and the pitcher for our model. And while there is a lot of data about these different pitches and the pitchers, it can still be difficult to predict exactly what type of pitch is thrown according to the pitcher. For instance, the difference between different types of fastballs, a four-seam and two-seam, can be different by less than a mile per hour and forty rotations per minute (as thrown by Aaron Nola of the Philadelphia Phillies). In our model that we try to create, we are use these variables, along with the last three pitches thrown for each pitch type, to try to predict what pitch was just thrown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-background-and-previous-work&#34;&gt;2. Background and Previous Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baseball players are always looking for a way to have an edge over their opponents. Whether that is through training, recovery, use of supplements, and by watching film or statistics to find what your opponent’s struggle with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several existing models that have been made to predict pitch type. We plan on examining them to determine how this can be done. We are looking for a general blueprint of which multiple models have used and/or have followed. This also allowed us to see what type of datasets would best be used for an analysis of this sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;21-harvard-college-model&#34;&gt;2.1 Harvard College Model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first prediction model we studied was done through Harvard University &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This prediction model was very complex and explored many different types of analysis. They first investigated doing a binary classification model. However, they ultimately decided against this because the label of pitches did not accurately represent what they actual were. This led them into multi-class predictive models in which they used. The other types of analysis were boosted trees, classification trees, random forests, linear discriminant analysis, and vector machines. The main point of this report was to see if they could replicate previous work done, but they ultimately failed at each one. This resulted to them in trying to determine if one can correctly predict pitch type selection. There research showed that machine learning cannot correctly predict pitch type due to the many different aspects that need to be analyzed. They hoped that their work could be used as a reference for future work done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found this article to be very useful in our work since it stands as a reference for future work. We found this to be helpful in our review of predictive models for pitch types due to the different models they tried to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;22-north-carolina-state-university-model&#34;&gt;2.2 North Carolina State University Model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prediction model created by North Carolina State University &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; was created to predict the next pitch that was going to be thrown. Their model compared old data to the current live data of a game, they are using many different types of data to predict the next type of pitch. They used a very large database that consisted of 287 MLB pitchers who had an average of 81 different pitch features (pitch type, ball rotation, speed, etc.). They are trying to determine if the next pitch will be a fastball or an off-speed pitch. Like the previously mentioned model, this model is also using trees to give a classification output. The parent node is the first type of pitch thrown, which then leads to if the pitch was a strike or a ball, then it uses this information and compares it to their dataset to predict the next set of nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found this to be very useful for our review since their model worked correctly and it used current data from the game. With Statcast today, we find this to be very important since all of this information is recorded and logged as each pitch is thrown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-dataset&#34;&gt;3. Dataset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major League Baseball first started using Statcast in 2015, after a successful trial run in 2014. Statcast &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; provided the MLB with a way to collect and analyze huge amounts of data in real time. Some of the data it collects, which is used in many different models, includes the pitcher’s name, pitch type, release spin, release speed, and the amount of times each pitch was thrown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we do not need all the data Statcast collects, we found a dataset with the datatypes listed above &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We chose this dataset because it contains a significant amount of data that can be used for a prediction model. The dataset contains a lot of information about not only the pitchers, but about the batters. The database shows what each batter has done against every type of pitch they have faced, whether they hit the ball, fouled it, swung and missed, etc. We felt as if this data is very important as well since coaches and pitchers will want to know how the batter reacts to different pitches and the different locations of each pitch. This would be a vital part to any pitch prediction model as coaches signal to the pitchers what types of pitches to throw according the strengths and weaknesses of the batters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-search-and-analysis&#34;&gt;4. Search and Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After conducting our background research, we determined that in order to build an accurate model to predict which pitch was just thrown, you would need to use a similarity analysis tool model with classification trees. This model allows us to take old data and compare it to the live data of the pitch. By comparing the live data to the older data, it will give the most accurate results due to how the players are playing during that game. A batter may struggle with a certain type of pitch that day and not another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The similarity analysis tool model would best be used to find instances of the batter in certain pitch counts. For instance, this tool would analyze the different amount of times the batter has faced a count 1 – 2 (1 ball and two strikes), and then find what pitch they saw next and what the outcome was. This information would then be filtered to see what pitch will have the best outcome for the pitcher, it would tell them what pitch to throw and where to throw it. This is where the classification trees would then be used. The trees would classify the recommended pitches to throw and their location to the types of pitches that they throw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-limitations&#34;&gt;5. Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several limitations to predictive models for pitch types &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The biggest is pitch classification itself. Pitchers ultimately pick what types of pitches they throw and as some pitches behave like others, different pitchers can classify the same pitch type as something else. For example, the traditional curve ball and a knuckle curve react the same. Other classification challenges that can be faced can be related to how the pitcher is playing. As the game goes on, pitcher’s velocities traditionally decrease due to their arms tiring, this could result in misidentification between different types of fastballs. The last limitation that could affect the pitch classification could be the PITCHf/x system malfunctioning or interference with the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-conclusion&#34;&gt;6. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report discusses the use of predictive model in baseball and how they can be used to predict the next pitch thrown. By reviewing previous models down by Harvard &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and by North Carolina State University &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, we determined that the best way to build a predictive model would be by using a similarity analysis tool model with classification trees. With the Carolina State University’s successful model, we also concluded that there were limitations to it, as different pitchers classify their pitches differently and telling different pitches apart due to the similar behaviors. The use of predictive models in baseball could change the game as it gives the pitchers an advantage over the batters. We hope that this report can show how big analytics can affect the game of baseball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Basketball Association and the deciding factors in understanding how the game should be played in terms of coaching styles, positions of players, and understanding the efficiencies of shooting certain shots is something that is prevalent in why analytics is used. Analytics is a topic space within basketball that has been growing and emerging as something that can make a big difference in the outcomes of gameplay. With the small analytic departments that have been incorporated within teams, results have already started coming in with the teams that use the analytics showing more advantages and dominance over opponents who don&amp;rsquo;t. We will analyze positions on the court of players and how big data and analytics can further take those positions and their game statistics and transform them into useful strategies against opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords:&lt;/strong&gt; basketball, sports, team, analytics , statistics, positions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction&#34;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Basketball Association was first created in the year of 1946 with the name of BAA (Basketball Association of America). However, in 1949 the name was changed to the NBA with a total of 17 teams&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. As time progressed the league started picking up steam and more and more teams began to join and it wasn’t until the 90’s that we see the total amount of NBA teams be produced.This league consists of professional basketball players from both national and international spaces of the world. As there are 16 roster spots per team and 32 teams in total, only the very most athletic, skillfull, and colossal individuals are chosen to represent this league.  Now, knowing the special skillsets of individual players, the founder of basketball, James Naismith, created positions to maximize these individual players for team success. On the court there are 5 positions : point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;11-point-guard&#34;&gt;1.1 Point Guard&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with the point guard, generally these individuals are the smallest players on the court with an average height around 6&#39;2 tall. With what these player lack in height they make up for in skillset in terms of quickness, passing, agility, ball handling, and natural shooting ability. Point guards are generally looked at to be the floor general of the team and take up the job of setting up the coach&amp;rsquo;s gameplan and teamates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;12-shooting-guard&#34;&gt;1.2 Shooting Guard&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shooting guard is a generally a slightly taller player than the point guard and like the name suggests they are generally the player known for their indiviualisitc shooting prowess whehter if it is beyond the 3 point line or in the mid-range. Shooting guards are known to be positioned in the perimeter(outside the arc) as a partner to the point guard. On occasion, the role of the shooting guard is expanded in the case that the point guard is pressured so the role may be for the shooting guard to be better at defense or a player that can help in the playmaking duties of the point guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;13-small-forward&#34;&gt;1.3 Small Forward&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small forward is where things change in terms of roles when comparing to the guards of that were previously mentioned above. They can be considered hybrids in the sense that they can both operate on the perimeter like guards and can go down low like power forwards and centers which will be discussed later. Noramlly with wings(another name for small forward) with an average height around 6&#39;7, there are a plethora of responsibilites in order to be considered effective. The reason for this is because generally speaking, small forwards are the most athletic player on the court. They basically have most the agility and ball handling of guards and most of the physicallity and power of power forwards/centers. Understandibly, there are tasked with big defensive assignments and are usually looked at to be a decent to above-average producer on offense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;14-power-forward&#34;&gt;1.4 Power Forward&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power forward position is where the physicallity of players matters more. Generally these players are around 6&#39;9 to 6&#39;11 and are heavier than most players. Becuase of this they give up speed and shooting which is why they operate around the free throw line and basket. They are looked at to protect the interior with the center from smaller players and small forwards driving in the lane to the basket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;15-center&#34;&gt;1.5 Center&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The center is considered mostly the point guard of the defense of the team. They are generally the anchor that protects the rim primarily and takes up defensive assignemtns and calls. Without a competent center, a team can see their defense take a hit. Along with defense, centers are good options to go to when the team has offensive lulls since the easiest shot to make in the nba is a hook shot or layup and the center operates 3 feet from the basket. Centers generally range from 6&#39;11 to as high as 7&#39;6 in height. On rare occasions you can see 6&#39;9 to 6&#39;10 centers take the court and that is generally because of play-style or above-average defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-era-of-analytics&#34;&gt;2. Era of Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Basketball Association continues to not only grow in the sense of continued personnel but an increase of cap(cash flow) amongst teams as well. Within the scope of this prosperous cap situation that the NBA has accumulated over the years through merchandising, tickets, and tv deals, teams have found flexibility in the ability to create the optimal situation for whatever version of basketball the General Manager sees fit for the vision of the team. In terms of better understanding how this can be accomplished it is best to understand what spurred this action of finding styles to lead to the best team success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That particular action is players such as Stephen Curry, a 6-3 NBA point guard, that led to the change in utilizing analytics. The year Steph Curry broke through as an MVP, his team; the Golden State Warriors broke the former Chicago Bulls record of 72-9. This in big part was due to Steph Curry breaking the 3pt record as well as Golden State adopting the small ball philosophy. This particular year gave birth to the era of analytics because of how dominate those two approaches were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;31-the-houston-rockets&#34;&gt;3.1 The Houston Rockets&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has then inspired teams to introduce analytics departments to measure ways to beat the game and exploit mismatches in defensive schemes and height within players. An example of a team that spearheaded this change in strategy is the Houston Rockets. Their GM(General Manager) Daryl Morey was a MIT graduate who advocated for a team that primarily shoots three point shots as their main forte&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The science behind this concept was that 33% shooting from the three point line measure to 50% from the two point line respectively. This was in the works in the year of 2017 just two years removed from Steph Curry&amp;rsquo;s three point dominance in his MVP season. In terms of numbers representing the change, the 2018 Houston Rockets attempted approximately 82% of their shot attempts around the three point line and the restricted area(the circle around ~5 feet in diameter surrounding the rim)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The next best team in that department was eleven percent down at 71% in terms of attempts. In this year, the Rockets won their conference at a record of 65 wins - 17 losses as well as break the NBA record in three pointers attemted and made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;32-tools&#34;&gt;3.2 Tools&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to evaluate these players and acquire the data necessary for analyization, the NBA partnered with a company name STATS to provide the necessary tools for data collection. STATS worked with the NBA by installing six cameras in each basketball arena in order to, &amp;ldquo;track player and referee movements at 25 frames per second to get the most analytical data for teams and the NBA to analyze&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;rdquo; This is very effective in terms of showing the play-by-play moves of players in a system as well as even how referees move. With players, these tools can serve as a chess board where the coach is able to watch pieces move and can determine where certain positions could be optimized to its maximum efficiency. This allows for film sessions to be more productive and helpful for players to better see where they fit and even improve in. In terms of referees, throughout sports it is known that referees have cost some games due to missed calls or questionable decisions. This technology can help in terms of understanding: 1) how a specific referee calls certain fouls and 2) if there seems to be a number count of fouls depending on what team the referee is reffing historically. Understanding both the tendencies of players and refs alike gives coaching staffs a direction to go in when preparing for opponents on a game-by-game basis&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;33-draft-philosophy&#34;&gt;3.3 Draft Philosophy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another facet of the game that is likewise impacted by the tools and techniques described in 3.2 is the NBA draft. The NBA draft consists a total of 60 players selected in two rounds combined. The general consensus before this analytics era was to choose the best player avaible most of the time. Teams back then usually drafted big men(e.g. forwards and centers) because it was considered a safe pick and known to help your team better in more areas. As time passed, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen a shift to more guards that are drafted instead to fit the narrative the analytics presents to teams regarding the best path to success. For example, earlier Stephen Curry was mentioned to be one of the foundational reasons that the analytics movement was largely adapted. The year Curry got drafted, the #1 pick in the draft was Blake Griffin who at the time was considered the best Power Forward in the draft while Curry was drafted at 8th overall and even James Harden of the Houston Rockets was drafted 3rd&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. As we fast forward to 2020, both Curry and Harden are looked at as the two best players from their draft class with Curry revolutionizing the three point shot and Harden being the ultimate analytics player with his ability to manipulate the defense and draw free throws from fouls like no player has ever done. As years passed, there has been a shift in drafting players with the mindset of that particular players&#39; potential over fit in the sense that teams look for the best available player that fits the teams system the most efficiently&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. An example is the upcoming 2020 NBA draft where there is a question of who will become the #1 and 2 pick respectively. The Golden State Warriors have the 2nd pick in the draft because of a year of injuries for all of their star players. So, they typically aren&amp;rsquo;t looking for a player like most losing teams are doing in the draft. In the eyes of many scouts, some view a player like Lamelo Ball, a 6&#39;7 point guard as the best player or at least second best and others see players like Anthony Edwards(SG), James Wiseman(C) and Deni Advija(SG) as potentially better fits and safer picks. However, for the warriors rumors over social media from notable sources have shown that they aren&amp;rsquo;t interested in drafting Lamelo Ball as he is a point guard and they have Steph Curry already. They instead prefer to choose a Small Forward or Center that can help their defensive potential and style of play. Years ago, that may not have been the case as the best player available would usually come off the board and the team would figure it out after that. Thus, this shows how analytics has not only persuaded teams to change their play styles and system but also the players that come with it whether they are veterans or incoming rookies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-background-work-and-advanced-analytics-in-basketball&#34;&gt;4. Background Work and Advanced Analytics in Basketball&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering how the impacts of how implemented analytics has aided the NBA atmosphere as mentioned above, we look to learn technologies and work that help bring this about. This begins with camera systems that have been implemented by a company named SportVU who&amp;rsquo;ve helped bring about change in NBA arenas since 2013 that track player and basketball movement across the arenas&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This system goes further in the analysis of collecting data in the context of individual player statistics being captured as well as their positioning on the court and speed in particular instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus by capturing the basic statistics such as points, assists, rebounds, steals and blocks. Analytical tools such as Player Efficiency Ratings and Defensive Metrics were better used to analyze players and their individualistic impacts on the basketball court. The impacts of these analytical/computational metrics are represented in many organizations abilities to understand the scope of player&amp;rsquo;s salaries and positioning on the court, who to draft, and helps sports analyst on TV shows such as FS1 and ESPN to easily break down the game of Basketball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where algorithims come to play as an algorithim needs a dataset from which it can train itself and develop statistical patterns to help in predictive analysis and representation for coaches and teams to utilize respectively. An example of this is show through students named Panna Felsen and Lucy from the University of California Berkely, who are developing a software name Bhostgusters that helped analyze the body positions of players and further the response and movements of a team to certain plays run by the opposition&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The end goal of this for coaches to be able to draw up a play on a tablet and see potential conflicts, results, and how opponents may counteract that particular play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other technologies that are being developed and implemented are things like, CourtVision, which is technology that shows the statistics of a player making a shot based on that players&#39; past statistics and position on the court. As the player is moving through the court the numbers change to reflect his efficiency on certain areas on the court based on this. As stated by Marcus Woo, the author of this article, these technologies aren&amp;rsquo;t meant to replace the systems in place but instead are there the help in efficiency and effectiveness&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-algorithims-associated-with-nba&#34;&gt;5. Algorithims associated with NBA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the variety of algorithims used in the National Basketball Association, we will be analyzing
the range of algorithims discussed through articles and papers on google scholar. We looked at a total of five
algorithims that were commonolu shown to be used of the most searches when it came to predictive and learning
analysis within NBA analytics departements and outside agencies. The algorithims as presented are: K-means,
Artificial Neural Networks, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Linear
Progression was by far the most written on topic within the five algorithims listed above with a total of 11,000
searches. It is followed by the Support Vector Machines with 5,240, Logistic Regression with 4,500, Artificial
Neural Networks with 4,300, and K-Means with 1,590 search results(*all results via google scholar search bar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;51-k-means&#34;&gt;5.1 K-Means&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first algorithim we&amp;rsquo;ll look at is K-Means which is classified as generally the &amp;ldquo;clustering algorithim&amp;rdquo; which takes the form of initializing a single point of k or the mean and organizing the data towards that particular mean&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is then repeated over and over until the appropriate results are found and compiled. Now as National Basketball Association statistics are inserted this can be used to cluster players together than fit the criteria on certain outcomes of points, rebounds, assists, and blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;52-linear-regression&#34;&gt;5.2 Linear Regression&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linear Regression, which is very commonly used in machine learning is very effective as a predictor tool. It works by forming &amp;ldquo;regression coefficients&amp;rdquo; that stems from pitting together independent variables which help in predictions within a game&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. So, throught the input and output variables taht are presented predictive measurements can be performed to highlight potential productivety. An example is the &amp;ldquo;Box-Plus-Minus&amp;rdquo;. This was created to show a basketball player&amp;rsquo;s overall court production and effect through their statistics, what position they play on the court and the wins and losses that team incurs because of this&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This was built through linear regression and shows through charts based on statistics how productive a player is or potentially can be given the system and oppurtunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;53-logistic-regression&#34;&gt;5.3 Logistic Regression&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly to Linear Regression, Logistic Regression shares a lot of features in terms of the formula used for prediction except it utilizes a sigmoid as opposed to a linear function when performing calculations. Weight values are the main form of predictions in whatever form of scenario or situation in which that analyst wants to produce&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. An example of this is shown through a logistical regression analysis performed by Oklahoma State University on clutch and non-clutch shots by players in the National Basketball Association. The premise of this is taking the data of an individual player based on their shooting percentages in spots on the floor relative to the distance of the defender on them and using that to figure out the potential of a player making a shot in the clutch(universally known as the last two minutes in a close game)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This then shows how a predictive algorithm can be utilized not only based on solely percentages and efficiencies but also with the inclusion of situation on a basketball floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;54-support-vector-machines&#34;&gt;5.4 Support Vector Machines&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support Vector Machines are considered to be a very formidable tool when it comes to measuring classification issues. This modeled machine creates a decision-making tree that helps in the predictions of basketball games and thus can help coaches form strategies and gameplans around what the model predicts can happen. Additional advantages that come with this tool is its ability to operate in high dimensions, the ability to identify kernels, and its memory efficiency&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The minor issue with this machine is the lack of rule generation but as it is more of an emerging tool overtime this is something that is relatively fixable&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The advantages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;55-artificial-neural-networks&#34;&gt;5.5 Artificial Neural Networks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Artificial Neural Networks the use of the Multi-Layer Perceptron is prevalent and it is highlighted by the vertices of a group in correlation to input varables and comes out with the output&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This tool according the Beckler is also considered to be, &amp;ldquo;an adaptive system that changes its structure based on external and internal information flows during the network training phase&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. With this, the Artificial Neural Network is considered to be one of the most accurate predictive tools when it comes to basketball and can predict patterns as more data is inputed&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-conclusion&#34;&gt;6. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As time progresses, we will continue to see the use of analytics as well as the expanision of analytics departments in not only the National Basketball Association but other professional sports as well. The impacts of analytics have been highlighted through recent years as mentioned above with the change to styles of play, and the way coaches approach gameplans before each respective game is played. As Adam Silver, the commissioner of the National Basketball Association stated, &amp;ldquo;Analytics have become front and center with precisely when players are rested, how many minutes they get, who they’re matched up against&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;rdquo; Through this, Silver explains not only to technical aspect of basketball that analytics supports but the physical aspect which can aid in preventing things like player injuries and rest. Understandibly, this highlights how analytics can help the league now and in the future; especially when more sophisticated machine learning tools and algorithims are produced for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of my report is big data in e-commerce. E-commerce is a big part of todays society. During the shopping online, the recommend commodities are fitter and fitter for my liking and willingness to buy. This is the merit of big data. Big data use my purchase history and browsing history to analyze my liking and recommend the goods for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our everyday lives, e-commerce is now a critical element. It redefines trading practices worldwide. Over the years the growth of eCommerce has been profound. As we move forward, we are learning how to grow eCommerce in this era and how to run an eCommerce company. The dominant mode of trading was brick-and-mortar until the rise of eCommerce. Brick and mortar firms have at least one physical location in supermarket stores. Goods must be bought and sold by active and physical contacts between the buyer and the seller. Brick and mortar trading continues, but eCommerce is increasingly replacing. Many brick and mortar retailers in an evolutionary manner turn themselves into eCommerce stores. This includes an online presence and bringing key company practices online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eCommerce market is increasingly developing as the Internet becomes more available in various areas of the world. Traditional retail companies are migrating to the eCommerce space. Expand their appeal to customers and remain competitive as well. It is clear that the eCommerce shops provide great experiences for customers. An improved flexibility of the Internet, faster purchases, plenty of goods and customized deals, the lack of physical presence restrictions and interaction make it attractive for customers to buy online. E-commerce has many advantages for you, whether you are a company or a customer. Learn all about powering eCommerce sites such as Shopify and Big Commerce online shops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords:&lt;/strong&gt; e-commerce, big data, data analysis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction&#34;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-commerce is already changed by big data a lot. As we can see in the lecture slides, the retail store was closed rapidly in the past three years. It can be seen that e-commerce has begun to take shape and has been accepted by customers. E-commerce can make shopping more convenient for customers, and enable companies to better discover current trends and customers&#39; favorite categories for better development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For customers, they can find the item they want easier than find it in a retail store. Maybe the customer doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what he wants, doesn&amp;rsquo;t know his brand, only knows its style, but that&amp;rsquo;s enough to search for the item on e-commerce. There are also some e-commerce services that offer photo search, which makes shopping easier. Shopping in e-commerce usually keeps a record of the purchase. In this way, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to go to a retail store to buy some products repeatedly. Instead, you can directly find the products in the record and place orders, which saves a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For companies, there are more changes. They can analyze customers preferences and purchasing power based on their browsing data, shopping cart data, and purchasing data. Large enough to predict the future business trend, small enough to better see the customer&amp;rsquo;s evaluation of the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-commerce companies have access to a lot of data, which makes it easy for them to analyze product trends and customer preferences. As talent says, &amp;ldquo;Retail websites track the number of clicks per page, the average number of products people add to their shopping carts before checking out, and the average length of time between a homepage visit and a purchase. If customers are signed up for a rewards or subscription program, companies can analyze demographic, age, style, size, and socioeconomic information. Predictive analytics can help companies develop new strategies to prevent shopping cart abandonment, lessen time to purchase, and cater to budding trends. Likewise, e-commerce companies use this data to accurately predict inventory needs with changes in seasonality or the economy&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. There is an example of the Lenovo, to enhance the customer experience and stand out from the competition, Lenovo needs to understand customers&#39; needs, preferences, and purchasing behaviors. By collecting data sets from various touchpoints, Lenovo USES real-time predictive analytics to improve customer experience and increase revenue per retail segment by 11 percent &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting customer needs is not just an immediate problem. E-commerce depends on having the right inventory in the future. Big data can help the company to be prepared for the emerging trend, in the slow or potential prosperity and development of the year, or around major activity plan marketing activities. E-commerce companies will compile large data sets. By evaluating the data of a few years ago, electronics retailers can plan accordingly inventory, inventory to predict peak, simplify the overall business operations, and predict demand. E-commerce sites, for example, can do it in the shopping rush hour in social media significantly depreciate sales promotion, to eliminate redundant products. In order to optimize pricing decisions, e-commerce sites can also provide a special discount. Through big data analysis and machine learning, learn when to offer discounts, how long they should last, and what discount prices are offered more accurately (para 8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-commerce is bound to dominate the retail market in the future because it can help retailers better analyze and predict future trends, which retailers cannot resist. At the same time, e-commerce provides better ways for customers to shop. With better analysis, retail companies will be able to provide better service to customers, so e-commerce will be more and more accepted and popular in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-background-research-and-previous-work&#34;&gt;2. Background Research and Previous Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Artur Olechowski wrote, &amp;ldquo;According to the IDC, the digital universe of data will grow by 61% to reach a smashing 175 zettabytes worldwide by 2025. There’s no denying that a large chunk of the digital world belongs to e-commerce, which takes advantage of customer social media activity, web browser history, geolocation, and data about abandoned online shopping carts. Most e-commerce businesses are able to collect and process data at scale today. Many of them leverage data analytics to understand their customers’ purchasing behaviors, follow the changing market trends, gain insights that allow them to become more proactive, deliver more personalized experiences to customers. The global Big Data in the e-commerce industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.27% between 2019 and 2028. But what exactly is Big Data? And how can e-commerce businesses capture this powerful technology trend to their advantage? In this article, we take a closer look at the key trends in the usage of Big Data technologies by e-commerce companies and offer you some tips to help you get started in this game-changing field&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common and widely used application of big data is in e-commerce. Nowadays, the application of big data in e-commerce is relatively mature. As Artur Olechowski wrote, &amp;ldquo;As businesses scale up, they also collect an increasing amount of data. They need to get interested in data and its processing; this is just inevitable. That’s why a data-driven e-commerce company should regularly measure and improve upon: shopper analysis, customer service personalization, customer experience, the security of online payment processing, targeted advertising&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also some disadvantages of the big data, or to say more need to do after getting the data. Artur Olechowski wrote, &amp;ldquo;Understand the problem of security — Big Data tools gather a lot of data about every single customer who visits your site. This is a lot of sensitive information. If your security is compromised, you could lose your reputation. That’s why before adopting the data technology, make sure to hire a cybersecurity expert to keep all of your data private and secure&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; . Security is always a big problem with big data. This is one of the components will be analyzed in my report. He also wrote, &amp;ldquo;Lack of analytics will become a bigger problem — Big Data is all about gathering information, but to make use of it, your system should also be able to process it. High-quality Big Data solutions can do that and then visualize insights in a simple manner. That’s how you can make this valuable information useful to everyone, from managers to customer service reps&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The analysis is also an important part of the big data. Only collecting data cannot help e-commerce anything. Security and analytics will be talked about in my report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-choice-of-data-sets&#34;&gt;3. Choice of Data-sets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QUARTERLY RETAIL E-COMMERCE SALES 2 nd QUARTER 2020:&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec_current.pdf&#34;&gt;https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec_current.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the dataset, the source website provided in the project requirements will be used, if there needs more information, data and information on the web will be searched for. As a result of recent COVID-19 incidents, many organizations work in a small capacity or have entirely ceased activities. The Census Bureau has tracked and analyzed the response and data quality in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monthly Retail Trade from Census will be analyzed. The Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce today reported that the forecast of U.S. retail e-commerce revenue for the second quarter of 2020 adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, but not for price adjustments, was $211.5 billion, a rise of 31.8 per cent (plus or minus 1.2 per cent) from the first quarter of 2020. Total retail revenues were projected at $1,311.0 billion for the second quarter of 2020, a decline of 3.9 percent (plus or minus 0.4 percent) from the first quarter of 2020. The e-commerce forecast for the second quarter of 2020 increased (para1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail e-commerce sales are estimated from the same sample used for the Monthly Retail Trade Survey (MRTS) to estimate preliminary and final U.S. retail sales. Advance U.S. online transactions are calculated from a subsample of the MRTS survey that is not of appropriate magnitude to calculate improvements in retail e-commerce transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stratified basic random sampling procedure is used to pick approximately 10,800 retailers, except food services, whose transactions are then weighted and benchmarked to reflect the entire universe of over two million retailers. The MRTS sample is focused on probability and represents all employer firms engaged in retail activities as described in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Coverage covers all vendors whether or not they are active in e-commerce. Internet travel agents, financial brokers and distributors, and ticket sales companies are not listed as retail and are not included with either the gross retail or retail e‐commerce sales figures. Non employees are reflected in the projections by benchmarking of previous annual survey estimates that contain non employer revenue based on administrative data. E-commerce revenues are included in the gross monthly sales figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MRTS sample is revised on a continuous basis to account for new retail employees (including those selling over the Internet), company deaths and other shifts in the retail business environment. Firms are asked to report e-commerce revenue on a monthly basis separately. For each month of the year, data for non-responsive sampling units shall be calculated from reacting sampling units falling under the same class of sector and sales size segment or on the basis of the company&amp;rsquo;s historical results. Responding firms account for approximately 67% of the e-commerce sales estimate and approximately 72% of the U.S. retail sales estimate for any quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimates are obtained by summing the weighted sales (either reported or charged) for each month of the quarter. The monthly figures are benchmarked against previous annual survey estimates. Quartal projections are determined summing up the monthly benchmarked figures. The forecast for the last quarter is a provisional forecast. The calculation is also open to revision. Data consumers who make their own projections using data from this study can only apply to the Census Bureau as the source of input data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article publishes forecasts optimized for seasonal variation and variations in holiday and trade days, but not for adjustments in rates. As feedback for the X‐13ARIMA‐SEATS programme, we have used the updated figures of quarterly figures of e-commerce revenue for the fourth quarter 1999 up to the present quarter. For revenue, we estimated the quarterly adjusted figures for each year with an additional modified monthly revenue forecast. Seasonal estimate adjustment is an approximation based on current and previous experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimates containing sample errors and non-sample errors in this article are based on a survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between the prediction and the results of the full population listing under the same sample conditions is the sampling error. This mistake happens when a national poll only tests a sub-set of the total population. Estimated sampling variance measurements are standard errors and variance coefficients, as stated in Table 2 of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-search-and-analysis&#34;&gt;4. Search and Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year the pandemic accelerated growth in ecommerce in the US, with online revenues projected to hit just 2022. The top 10 ecommerce retailers will strengthen their hold on the retail market with our Q3 American retail prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, revenues of US eCommerce are projected to hit $794.50 billion, up 32.4% annually. This is even more than the 18.0% predicted in our Q2, since customers are now ignoring shops and opting to buy online in the wake of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;ldquo;US Ecommerce Growth Jumps to More than 30%, Accelerating Online Shopping Shift by Nearly 2 Years&amp;rdquo;, it says, &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;We’ve seen ecommerce accelerate in ways that didn’t seem possible last spring, given the extent of the economic crisis,&amp;rsquo; said Andrew Lipsman, eMarketer principal analyst at Insider Intelligence. &amp;lsquo;While much of the shift has been led by essential categories like grocery, there has been surprising strength in discretionary categories like consumer electronics and home furnishings that benefited from pandemic-driven lifestyle needs&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, ecommerce revenues are projected to hit 14.4 percent and 19.2 percent of all US retail spending by 2024. Without purchases of petrol and cars, ecommerce penetration leaps to 20.6% (classes sold almost entirely offline).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;ldquo;US Ecommerce Growth Jumps to More than 30%, Accelerating Online Shopping Shift by Nearly 2 Years&amp;rdquo;, it writes, &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;There will be some lasting impacts from the pandemic that will fundamentally change how people shop,&amp;rsquo; said Cindy Liu, eMarketer senior forecasting analyst at Insider Intelligence. &amp;lsquo;For one, many stores, particularly department stores, may close permanently. Secondly, we believe consumer shopping behaviors will permanently change. Many consumers have either shopped online for the first time or shopped in new categories (i.e., groceries). Both the increase in new users and frequency of purchasing will have a lasting impact on retail&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online commerce will be so high that this year, at $4,711 trillion, this will more than compensate for the 3,2 percent fall in brick and mortar expenses. Complete US retail revenue will also remain relatively flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-conclusion&#34;&gt;5. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More users are benefiting from the majority of online resources, including eCommerce, as internet penetration and connectivity improve. In everyday life e-commerce has become a mainstream, with fundamental advantages. The e-commerce market is projected to reverse double digit growth in net accounts from anywhere around the world. However, e-commerce can expand enormously as digital payment options are growing in these areas. About 22% of the world&amp;rsquo;s stores are now online. By 2021, e-Commerce online revenues are projected to hit $5 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fru Kerik says, &amp;ldquo;The most popular eCommerce businesses worldwide are Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, and Walmart. These eCommerce giants have redefined the retail industry irrespective of location. They accumulate revenues that exceed billions of dollars yearly. As internet accessibility increases, these estimates would skyrocket. At the time of this writing, Amazon is present in 58 countries, Alibaba in 15, Walmart in 27, MercadoLibre in 18&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-Commerce firms have also contributed to the rise of e-Commerce through methodological findings. E-Commerce firms follow customer expectations and make important discoveries about the business-to-consumer model. These insights are then incorporated in market models, ensuring smooth future revenue increase globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2050 the United Nations is projecting that 90% of the world will have access to the internet. With the recent pandemic and the shift to most things being online we see how desperate people need internet to be able to do everyday tasks. The internet is a valuable utility and more people are getting access to it every day. We also are seeing more data is being sent over the internet with more than 24,000 Gigabytes being uploaded and processed per second across the entire internet. In this report we look at the progression of the internet and how it has changed over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction&#34;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyday people throughout the world connect to the internet with speeds never before seen. The internet has not always been this way and for some countries they are still not at the same speeds. The internet started out to be a slow connection of one computer to the other with large machines helping pass the data. This quickly changed to become a vast network of computers all connected to one another and using packet processing systems to transport data. With the internet seen as a new and important technology governments and companies soon started their own development of networks and expansions. These expansions and networks would be the ground work for what we call the internet today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the United Nations projecting that 90% of the entire population will have internet in 2050 and currently only 50% of the entire population &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; this work will look at how we started this movement and in what areas we need to improve on. Currently about 87% of American’s have access to the internet and use it daily while other countries like Chad only have 6.7% of their population using the internet. This can is from the vast resources America used to expand their networks and create the ideal internet connection that other countries strive to have. While other underdeveloped countries are trying to catchup and build their own infrastructure in the modern age, first world countries, like America, are expanding their networks to be better and more reliable. &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt; shows the current status of the percentage of the population in each country that has internet. Dark blue color is the best with greater than 70% of their population having internet access while the lighter blue is countries whose population is less than 18%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-334/raw/main/report/images/WorldPresent.png&#34; alt=&#34;Present World Population&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Shows the current percentage of the world’s population that has/uses internet within each country &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-background-and-current-works&#34;&gt;2. Background and Current Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1965 Thomas Merrill and Lawrence G. Roberts started the first ever wide-area computer network ever built. The internet first started out as huge machines that were sizes of small houses that were only capable of transferring small amounts of data or packets as they soon invented. The internet at the time was not even called internet but the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET). This Network backed by the U.S. Department Of Defense used node-to-node communication to send a messages. The first test was a simple test of sending the message of &lt;em&gt;LOGIN&lt;/em&gt; from one computer to the other. It crashed after &lt;em&gt;LO&lt;/em&gt; was sent. Following this devastating start improvements were made with the capabilities of that these computers could perform. With data now being sent throughout the network researchers needed to develop a standard on how packets should be sent. This is when the transmission control protocol and internet protocol (TCP/IP) was invented. It was soon adopted into the APARTNET in 1983 and became the standard on how computers should send and process data &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. TCP/IP is how packets are sent all over the internet. This system uses the packet-switched network where information is broken into packets and sent to different routers, the IP section of the system, and following the packets it was then put back together on the receiving end and resembled into what it was originally, TCP &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the internet was developed there was many different communities and the growth of these communities brought problems. There was no one group or organization that organized these groups and all these communities were on different platforms and areas. This is when the Internet Activities Board (IAB) and Tim Berners-Lee from MIT came together to develop the World Wide Web (WWW) and its primary community of World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). W3C is now the primary group who make protocols and standards for the WWW. This group is still actively watching and helping the WWW to make sure it is growing steadily and supported throughout the internet &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-dataset&#34;&gt;3. Dataset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compare countries internet usage and how many people in each country use the internet two datasets will be used. These datasets will look at the percentage of the population that has internet access &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the percentage of the population that use smartphones &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as that is another way people can access the internet. Once the data has been analyzed we looked at why the data is like this and how the data has changed to the way it is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-data-within-internet&#34;&gt;4. Data Within Internet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet has progressed largely from not being able to send a simple message like &lt;em&gt;LOGIN&lt;/em&gt; from one computer to another to being able to process terabytes of data. We are now seeing 24,000 gigabytes per second being passed and uploaded throughout the internet &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. To give perspective on this 1 gigabyte can hold up to 341 average sized digital pictures, or one megabyte is equal to 873 plain text pages and there are 1000 megabytes in 1 gigabyte. That is 873,000 pages of plain text per gigabyte and the internet is sending and uploading about 24,000 gigabytes per second, that is 24,952,000,000 pages of plain text pages being sent over the internet. This large quantity of data and information is passed throughout the internet every second and usually without any hiccups or data issues. This data and information has not always been here &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Most of it is relatively new with 90% of most data on the internet being created post 2016. This data is still growing and will continue to grow. With more than 4.4 billion people on the internet all these users are pumping more data and this data is being passed around other users. With 7.5 billion people on earth almost 60% of people on earth are using the internet and are contributing to the amount of data on it. This change has not been a slow change but an explosion of change and new users. In 2014 there was only 2.4 billion users on the internet. Within 5 years we see a growth of 2 billion users and with that we see an ever increasing amount of data being sent and uploaded &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Some of this data is being stored and used throughout the world every day and we have companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft who store this data. Between them it is estimated that they store 1.2 million terabytes of internet data. Just looking at these 4 companies we see the magnitude of the data that is being stored and kept throughout the internet and each day these numbers grow &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. To give some perspective on how large that data storage is 1 Terabyte is 1000 gigabytes of data. Cisco even estimates that there has been over 1 zettabyte of data created and uploaded on the internet in 2016, zettabyte is 1000 exabytes an exabyte is 1000 petabytes and a petabyte is 1000 terabytes &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. That is a lot of data and information being sent and passed throughout the internet. It is also estimated that in 2018 we have reached 18 zettabytes. We see the growth of this data being passed throughout the internet in 2 years from being 1 zettabyte to being 18. This growth will not stop or slow down but continue to expand and grow as it is being predicted to be about 175 zettabytes within the year 2025. &lt;em&gt;That is enough information to store on DVDs that can circle the earth 222 times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Now this data is not all being stored but just uploaded or sent to other users. With an overwhelmingly number of this data coming from the social media companies and posts people are sending to each other. We are also seeing the growth within searches with Google getting over 3.5 Billion searches every day. We will see how this data came to be and how the internet slowly took over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;41-data-analysis-of-internet-change&#34;&gt;4.1 Data Analysis of Internet Change&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the datasets &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; we can analyze how this transition took place throughout the world and how the internet progressed. Looking at 2017 data we see that all first world countries have more than 70% of their population using the internet but other countries are still struggling. Looking at the progression of the internet we see that America started off the strongest and most explosive growth out of all countries and has maintain that growth while other countries and continents have fallen behind. We will look at how the internet started so strong in America and how it has teetered in other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-americas-internet-history&#34;&gt;5. America’s Internet History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the 1990’s data we see that America is at .79% of the population having internet while the entire world as a whole is less than .0495%. The only countries who are close to America is Norway, Canada, Sweden, Finland, and Australia. These countries populations are all less than American’s percentage with Norway the closest at .7%. &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt; shows these percentages and how drastic these differences are with some countries having 0% of their entire population having access to the internet &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. How is America and these five countries populations have so many more users using the internet compared to the rest of the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-334/raw/main/report/images/World1990.png&#34; alt=&#34;World Population in 1990&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2:&lt;/strong&gt; This figure shows the 1990’s current population % of people accessing the internet &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;51--americas-population-data&#34;&gt;5.1  America’s Population Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the WWW being developed and deployed within America it makes sense that America would be the first country to expand their internet and have a larger portion of their population using the internet over the rest of the world. The dramatic difference of America having .79% of their population over the worlds .0495%, America was able to drastically take advantage of their early start and develop it to their needs. When looking at the world’s population with internet compared to America’s, American population with internet accounts for more than half of the world’s population with internet, with America’s population being 250 million in 1990’s and .79% of their population having internet that means 1.975 million people had internet in America while only 2.614 million globally had internet &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. America at the time was a leader in the world on internet and it is interesting how it got there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;52-how-america-started-the-network-and-government-help&#34;&gt;5.2 How America Started the Network and Government Help&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the development of APARTNET within the United States the Government saw the opportunity to help expand it within its own country. The U.S. Government helped the expansion of the internet by financing contracts and building satellite sites across the world to gain access to the internet. These sites where built mostly in military bases across the world and helped countries tap into the internet without the huge cost of infrastructure . The Department of Defense (DOD) also saw an opportunity in the new Internet with their creation of MILNET. MILNET connected numerous military compounds and their computers to the United States main hub. These connections used the APARTNET but were able to disconnect and use its own network if it became compromised. These connections made it able for the internet to spread to different countries since the United States military is set up in so many countries and have bases all over the world. Most of these connections were prioritized in the United States allied  countries like Norway, Australia, Canada, and EU hence why these countries have a large population using their internet in 1990, &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt;. All the infrastructure was already set up because of the military bases and the satellites the United States built for it. These countries took advantage of it and connected their people to the internet for the fraction of the cost &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;53--national-science-foundation-involvement&#34;&gt;5.3  National Science Foundation Involvement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet also progressed quickly to these countries and throughout the United States population because of the use of super computers which helped the connections and speed of the internet. The Reagan administration saw an important need to develop these super computers that could broaden the connection and networks of the computers. National Science Foundation (NSF) had a super computer already on their network but with the help of the administration they were able to expand that network to all internet users. The new network that NSF developed was the NSFNET. This network connected academic users to the super computer and those computers to other computers. Creating this intertwined network that was all able to use the speed and power of a super computer. It expanded the speed to be 1.5 megabits per second and would replace the APARTNET network which only could handle 50 kilobytes per second. Because of NSFNET we saw an explosion of growth within the internet with it growing over 10% each month in 1990. This is why United States had so many more users than any other country because they were able to use this faster and better network. NSF saw the need to expand elsewhere and used the NSFNET to start connecting the world globally. Using the pre-installed infrastructure of the old Satellite internet they were able to connect countries that already had internet with ease. This is why the American allies were able to have so many of their own population on the internet when comparing it to the world &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;54-present-geographical-challenges-for-spread-of-internet-within-america&#34;&gt;5.4 Present Geographical Challenges for Spread of Internet Within America&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the largest challenges with the spread of the internet in the United States is how vast the country is. With a size of 4 million miles^2 it was a challenge to reach everyone within the United States with internet. With an also ever increasing size of rural living more people are living outside of cities were it can be harder to get internet. About 3% of American’s living in urban areas lack access to broadband but comparing that to the rural we see that 35% the population lack it. That is 20 million American’s that do not have access to high speed broadband or internet because of where they live. The reason for why rural users lack the broadband capabilities is that the cost to run high speed internet to those areas is too much and the high speeds cannot reach that far from the hubs &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. When comparing these rural areas to urban areas we also see that urban areas almost always have more than three options for broadband while rural areas can be limited. Based on &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3&lt;/strong&gt; we see that all of the urban centers have access to these high speed broadbands and have options for what type of company they want. While rural areas struggle to have more than 2. .12% of rural areas have 0 access to any company that give broadband while only .01% of urban areas have 0 &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. To help the spread of internet to these rural areas the Government has decided to help again. Recently the Government has signed in the Broadband Data Act which will help identify the rural areas that need help and how they can fix the issues at hand. Congress has also packaged in 100 million to help this digital divide and try and better the situation. This process was expedited because of the recent pandemic and how desperate people are to get on the internet &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3:&lt;/strong&gt; This image shows the broadband capabilities throughout the nation. The legend below the picture depicts what each color means. We see from this chart that all urban areas have more than 12 high speed broadband providers will rural areas mostly have 1-2 options. This is the challenge for rural America when they are stuck with one option and that option can sometimes not even provide the fastest internet and will also be expensive &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;55-summary-of-americas-internet&#34;&gt;5.5 Summary of America’s Internet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the direct involvement of the United States Government the internet would have had a slower progression than the one we are seeing today. Without the military and the NSF the internet would not have been the same and could have looked a lot different. We would not have had the same widespread start without all the military bases having all the required infrastructure for the internet and we would not have had the required needs for the internet because of the vast contracts that the military supplied. This is how America was able to be so far ahead of the rest of the World and why the American allies were able to also build up their own infrastructure and take advantage of the infrastructure supplied by America. We also would have had a lot slower internet if it was not for America and the connection of the super computers on the networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-africas-struggles-to-get-continent-wide-internet&#34;&gt;6. Africa’s Struggles to get Continent Wide Internet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the data within Data World Bank we can see the vast change within countries. Some countries populations double how many people are using the internet each year. One region to look at specifically is Africa. Africa did not have each country within it have internet until 2000. That is 20 years after the start and development of the internet. When looking at the entire population of Africa only 16.18% of the them had internet access or used internet access. Comparing this America’s 43.1% and Canada’s 51.3% we see a huge disparity here. We also see that the Average population that uses internet in Africa being .385%. This is dramatically low but given that Africa is an underdeveloped country and has had lots of struggles makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;61-how-did-africa-get-their-internet&#34;&gt;6.1 How did Africa get their Internet?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started very early with Africa getting the first computer in 1980’s. This computer started how their network would work and how they would setup their own infrastructure. Most of the universities in Africa were the ones who lead the new technology age for Africa. These universities became the hotspots for computing and the internet. Africa also got some major help from the Internet Society &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The Internet Society is a nonprofit organization that helps people connect to the internet and can help countries setup their own networks &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In 1993 the Internet Society held a large workshop that helped a lot of underdeveloped countries connect to the internet and teach them all how to supply their population with this critical utility. Each following year the workshop hosted a new event which grew in size and over 447 citizens attended it who were from African Countries. This helped bring the discussion how Africa can setup their network and get their people the vital resources they need &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Africa has also gotten help from other countries to help develop their infrastructure and get their internet systems going. On major help was America’s USAID LELAND initiative which supplied Africa 15$ million to help develop their infrastructure. This agreement made it possible for African countries to develop primary connections to their own networks from USA’s high speed network. With this deal that started in 1996 and ended in 2001 we see a large spike in the populations and countries who finally have access to internet &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. With the help of this resource Africa was able to start developing their own network organization for all of Africa called AfriNIC. AfriNic is similar to America’s IAB were they help to make sure the networks are open to everyone within Africa and that if there are issues they are solved. Africa began to develop into the modern age of the internet with this and started to catch up to others &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;62-africas-geographical-problems&#34;&gt;6.2 Africa’s Geographical Problems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Africa’s geography is causing similar problems to their internet distribution just like America’s. Africa is a ginormous continent with an area of 11.73 million miles^2. With that much land it can be hard to cover this entire continent with internet and provide people in rural areas with internet. About one third of the population is out of reach of all mobile broadband reach and can not get access to any internet. To cover this land Africa needs to invest an more infrastructure to cover this land with 250,000 base stations and 250,000 kilometers of fiber. Africa’s population is spread out throughout the whole country, based on &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4&lt;/strong&gt; we see all the connections and networks throughout Africa there are. It is estimated that 45% of African’s are to far away from any fiber network to connect to the internet. These areas with no networks or infrastructure are areas with low populations and not hotspots or major cities. This problem might not be solved for a while as companies will focus on hotspots rather than helping people in need to access the internet. One of the more recent developments that might help Africa is the SpaceX Satellite internet &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This can help them as they wont need the vast infrastructure to create the network and the connection will be able to reach all over the continent. Africa’s geography  limits people connection based on where they live and if they are near the water to connect the submerged connections. With more investment and new inventions we could see this geographical challenge tackled within 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-334/raw/main/report/images/AfricaGeo.png&#34; alt=&#34;Africa Geography&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Seeing the hotspots throughout the continent and where the internet access is shows the disparity of rural vs urban living. Hotspots of populations are targeted more for internet connection as it makes sense for companies financially to target those areas. This creates a large divide for areas inside the continent who do not have networks or any chance of connecting to the networks. This figure shows how this disparity is present within Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;63-current-trends-and-future-for-africa&#34;&gt;6.3 Current Trends and Future for Africa&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the recent data for World Data Bank we see that African countries have been having a comeback with the amount of people using the internet. Currently Africa has seen a large spike in people using the internet. This can be because of all these programs that have helped start its program but it is can also be from two-thirds of the population having phones that can connect to the internet. Africa still has a problem with less than 50% of its entire population having access to internet and a computer. There are still a lot of struggling countries like Niger that only have 5.3% of it is population that use and connect to the internet. Within this day and age having access to the internet is almost critical to survive and be a part of the world. With only 5.3% of their population having internet they are still struggling to have access for everyone. Comparing this to current America with 83% of the population having internet Africa is still far behind the curve of first world countries. This lack of internet has created an opportunity of some people to help or take advantage of Africa’s lack of infrastructure. China’s Company Huawei has agreed to build the first ever 5G network within Africa. This network will help the current population of phone users to connect to higher speeds and see a great increase in use of the internet. American countries Vanu and Parallel have also been tackling this issue with new network plans and innovative ideas to help Africa’s internet networks expand to the vast region. With a projected $160 Billion annual cost to develop and maintain a country wide infrastructure a lot of people believe they need more than just companies to help them &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. With no more help from outside countries it looks grim for Africa’s continued growth within the internet unless more companies come try to develop their own system and networks. Looking at &lt;strong&gt;Figures 5&lt;/strong&gt; we see how African countries have had a much slower progression towards internet when compared to other countries, &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6&lt;/strong&gt; shows America’s progression. &lt;strong&gt;Figure 7&lt;/strong&gt; also depicts the current status of Africa and how most countries within Africa are still below 18% of their population using internet within the current day and age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-334/raw/main/report/images/AfricaChange.png&#34; alt=&#34;Africa % Change&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Seeing these countries all mostly below 50% while major countries are over 70%-80% depicts how far behind Africa is within the internet. We can also see the change and growth of the internet within these countries and compare it to other countries. Comparing it to America’s growth they are nowhere near as explosive or close to being the current rate of America’s internet growth &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6:&lt;/strong&gt; America’s growth within the internet &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-334/raw/main/report/images/AfricaPresent.png&#34; alt=&#34;Africa Current&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 7:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the current status of Africa’s internet population percentage. Notice that most countries within Africa are less than 18% while the world population % is greater than 50%. This depicts how far behind Africa is with building their infrastructure &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;64-summary-of-africas-internet&#34;&gt;6.4 Summary of Africa’s Internet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With less help from outside countries Africa is almost on their own with decided how they should improve their Internet Capabilities. Companies are see this as an opportunity to develop and use their own technologies to help Africa with their issues. These companies will develop a new network to try and get the entire country connected and online. This could be a problem were Africa is not entirely in control of their internet and data but with no outside help from any other countries they might have to take the best options available and go with these companies. With the help of Internet Society and AfriNET Africa has already started developing programs and networks to connect the country but with the infrastructure cost being too high they still need help. These organizations could help maintain oversite within this work and make sure Africa does not get taken advantage of. As the world progresses to complete internet involvement Africa is still far behind the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;7-conclusion&#34;&gt;7. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After viewing the data and analyzing trends the team saw the large differences between countries with who had an early start within the area of internet development and those countries who are far behind. Analyzing the reason behind this we see that countries who had access to the internet early and were able to take advantage of their early start were able to have a much larger population percentage than the countries who did now. We also see that some countries would get help from outside countries but when those contracts expired they were left out to dry. Seeing America and the vast amount of allies it had in 1990’s-2000’s with their population with access to internet quadrupling those in less developed countries is staggering but when looking behind the data and the reason why we see that some countries are just not as equally equipped and don’t have the infrastructure to compete with other countries networks. With 90% of the population being projected to have access to the internet it will be interesting to see the change in these areas. As we get closed to that 90% it will be these less developed countries who will make staggering changes within their percentage of population compared to the other developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;71-limitations&#34;&gt;7.1 Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only one large dataset that had all the population sizes and percentages it can be difficult to check the accuracy of the data within the set. The datasets also contained a numerous amount of null data and/or incomplete data for a vast majority of countries. This hindered the ability to further look at the correct trends and analysis of the dataset. With also having not a vast knowledge of data analysis within data the team was not able to analyze the datasets for the planned project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;72-future-work&#34;&gt;7.2 Future Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team will continue to analyze these datasets and build their own programs to look see the different trends within these areas and countries. The team wants to keep working on the reason why they trends are happening and how these trends started. It is important to understand the reason behind the data and factors that lead to these data points. As the team progresses through the dataset, the team will continue to understand the factors and reasons within the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaming is one of the fastest growing aspects of the modern entertainment industry. It’s a rapidly evolving market, where trends can change in a near instant, meaning that companies need to be ready for near anything when making decisions that may impact development times, targets and milestones. Companies need to be able to see market trends as they happen, not post factum, which frequently means predicting things based off of freshly incoming data. Big data is also used for development of the games themselves, allowing for new experiences and capabilities. It’s a relatively new use for big data, but as AI capabilities in games are developed further this is becoming a very important method of providing more immersive experiences. Last use case that will be talked about, is monetization in games, as big data has also found a use there as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1--introduction&#34;&gt;1.  Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video game market is one of the fastest growing aspects of the modern entertainment industry, and in 2020 brought in 92 billion USD worldwide out of a total worldwide entertainment market value income of 199.64 billion USD. With global player count reaching 2.7 billion users, more and more people choose to spend some of their leisure time behind a controller or a keyboard &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This phenomenon isn’t exactly a new thing. Originally getting its start in 1972 with the release of the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home console with replaceable cartridges. The scale of this achievement was hardly recognized, as back then if you wanted to play something, the only option was arcades. Arcades were a social experience but being able to play the exact same titles, if slightly downgraded, at home was a breakthrough. These first gen consoles were quite clunky and by modern standards unimpressive, yet they were the vital first step for birthing what we now know today as the video game market. At that point games had been a thing for a around a decade, but they were primarily limited to a group of computer hobbyists, who would exchange copies of homebrew software amongst themselves. In this format it would be impossible to get any sort of mainstream popularity. With time, home consoles had changed this dramatically. Games become a mainstream phenomenon, which means that suddenly the potential player pool is a lot larger, and as a result we see an explosion in the popularity of gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;11-market-expansion--segmentation&#34;&gt;1.1 Market Expansion &amp;amp; Segmentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the decades, this market has grown into a massive global phenomenon, becoming one of the primary forms of media alongside film, music, and art. Thanks to all of this we have seen 3 distinct market segments emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal Computers – (Laptops and desktops)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consoles – (Nintendo Switch, 3DS, Xbox, Playstation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobile Phones – (Anything with the Google Play store and IOS Appstore)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each segment has some interesting specifics. Mobile games account for 33% of all app downloads, 74% of all mobile consumer spending and 10% of all raw time spent in apps. By the end of 2019 the amount of people who played mobile games topped 2.4 billion &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. An important reason for this is accessibility, since mobile phones as of today, are the most commonly bought tech item in the world. In many developing nations, mobile phones are a commonplace piece of tech that is owned by the majority of adults &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.As the global population increases in wealth and size, this trend is only set to increase. Meaning that any company that ignores the mobile phone market is loosing out of massive sums of money. The same is true, but for a lesser scale, in personal computers, meaning that as the population grows, the PC market will expand as well. This is less true for consoles but machines from the last console generation sold a combined 221 million units, with a yearly revenue of 48.7 Billion in 2019 &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Far cry from what mobile games make, but still rather significant, spelling good fortunes for the health of the industry in the coming years. As a result of all this, it is only natural that companies will focus more and more of their attention on the developing world for expansion This is where big data can help significantly,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-big-data-in-mobile-gaming-spaces&#34;&gt;2. Big data in mobile gaming spaces.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big reason for the integration of big data analytics into mobile games comes from the intelligence edge that it provides you in a competitive market space. Being able to track Key Performance Indicators, or KPI’s for short allows you to rapidly shift strategies to fix growing problems as soon as you see them. For example, customer retention is one of, if not the most important metric in any gaming product, but or mobile gaming this is especially critical since gaming attention spans are getting shorter, and in a market where attention spans are already low from the get-go, hemorrhaging customers can spell doom for any app &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, an important big data application is the CLTV – customer lifetime analysis, which tracks customer retention and average return per customer on a specific platform. Machine learning in this case factors in a lot of different variables that effect just how long the user will end up using your app before putting it down to go do something else.  Reducing the churn, or the rate at which you intake and expel customers is thus a key business consideration when bringing a new gaming product to market &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is more important for mobile game customers since the ROI per user on mobile platforms is generally lower, thus maximizing user count rapidly becomes an extremely important tactic to get a self-sustaining userbase that can bring in stable profits &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But how are games monetized in the first place, and how does big data play into it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;21-mobile-game-monetizaton&#34;&gt;2.1 Mobile game monetizaton&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most mobile games operate on the freemium model, where the base game is free, but you pay for things such as boosts, upgrades and cosmetics &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Systems such as this still allow you to earn most things in the game normally, yet make it prohibitively difficult to do so, requiring a large time investment. What happens often in this case is that players will spend money to save time and effort that would have normally gone into grinding out these items for free [9]. So why is this effective? Because the initial entry barrier is quite literally nonexistent and the main monetization fees don’t actually cost that much at first, making up mostly 5-10$ purchases&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This doesn’t seem like much, but this eventually reaches into the sunk cost fallacy where users get so ingrained in an ecosystem and simply don’t want to leave. Mobile monetization platform Tapjoy recently used big data analysis to identify 5 different categories of mobile users &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The one that interests us the most is the whales. Whales are called as such due to how despite making up only 10% of a game’s population, they will usually be responsible for 70% of the cash flow from games. Many developers work specifically to design systems that aren’t exactly fun but work more to trap players like this within the ecosystem. While we may not agree with this rather predatory practice, its another big data application to be cognizant of.
It works off the same principle that gambling does, via enticing potential rewards that don’t actually have publicly avaliable information about your actual chance to win. When the positive effect happens, it’s usually minor, but still works like a Skinner box trigger where the user gets the positive feedback that further keeps them in the churn loop &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Is it scummy? Many players think so but using big data in this case allows us to hyper target these users. Big data analytics generate user reports that show directly what users are most susceptible, how to reach them and most importantly how to stick them into the endless loop where they keep dumping more and more money into a game that many don’t really even love anymore &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; . For companies this is great, since it earns you a customer who is guaranteed to stay and dump money in a marketplace where getting the average user to pay even 5$ for anything is already a feat that many cant handle. Using big data lets developers and companies be 10 steps ahead of potential users. By the time they realize they are addicted its far too late. Similar systems are making their way into our desktop and console spaces as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;22-profits-from-monetization&#34;&gt;2.2 Profits from Monetization.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, microtransactions that function this way can now be found on every platform and genre, all due to how insanely profitable it is. This year, gaming industry valuations rose 30% because of the absurd amounts of money that get pulled in via microtransactions &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. All of this, possible only due to the massively increasing use of big data analytical tools. Why make a good game, when you can hyper tailor the monetization so that players are guaranteed to stop caring about how good your game actually is when they get sufficiently sucked in enough. This trend is only increasing since its predicted that by 2023, 99% of all game downloads will be free to play with various forms of microtransaction based monetization &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, its not all doom and gloom. Big data can also be used for some other really interesting applications when it comes to developing the game itself, and not just the predatory monetization methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-big-data-and-ai-development-on-in-game-ai-systems&#34;&gt;3. Big Data and AI Development on In-Game AI Systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last summer, the world of online poker had quite the shock when a machine learning algorithm beat 4 seasoned poker vets &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But poker is actually a fairly simple game, so why is this important? It’s a big deal due to how most games feature AI in one form or another. When one plays strategy games, they can usually immediately tell if they are playing versus an AI or vs an actual player due to how current AI tech still isn’t nearly as good as a regular player. However, in simple games like poker, you can make systems that almost perfectly copy human behavior. All that is required is that they are trained on the users of the game, and then become nearly indistinguishable from a regular player. This opens up massive new possibilities, because soon we will be able to mimic whole players so that even games that are functionally dead due to lower player counts can still have users enjoy content that was made for multiplayer and such. Plus, just having smarter AI for non-player characters and enemies would be a nice touch. Currently most games that have AI opponents function on a system that is called a Finite State Machine &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Systems like this have a strict instruction set that they can’t really deviate from, nor make new strategies.This causes everythign to feel scripted and dumb, yet this is also a fairly lightweight method of ai control. FSM can be refined into what is called a Monte Carlo Search Tree (MCST) algorithm, where computers will on their own, make decision trees based on the reward value of the tree endpoint. MCST’s can become massive, so in order to cut down on the sheer amount of processing power that is needed, developers will make the AI randomly select a few paths, which will then in turn be implemented as actions. This cut down version adds the randomness that players expect from other players, but also removes a lot of rigidity of traditional AI systems &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Using machine learning models on real player actions allows MCST models to be really close to how an actual player acts in specific situations. However, training machine learning models on players also has another, really interesting purpose – dual AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;31-ai-implementation&#34;&gt;3.1. AI implementation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some games, feature AI that is divided into two separate algorithms, the director, and the controller. Director AI, has only one objective, make the game experience as enjoyable as possible. It is a macro level passive AI that bases game triggers and events off of player action. For example, causing random noises when it detects player stress via their control inputs&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This means that the system can detect whether it needs to up the ante on what is actually happening in game, introduce new enemies, change environmental effects etc. This molds the experience into a completely unique system that learns from every player that has ever played the game. All of this data goes into crafting emerging experiences that can’t be replicated via a rigid AI system.  But this is only one piece of the puzzle as the other component of this system is the controller AI. Controller AI is the sidekick that the director AI uses to help immerse the player. We will explain how it works in detail, but what is important is that the controller AI is ultimately subordinate to the director.
In a normal AI system, the algorithm knows everything, can see everything and will pretend it has no idea about what the player is doing, yet is ultimately aware of their actions. This system is the easiest to make, but also can seem to players like the AI is cheating or being exceedingly stupid at times. Let’s use the example of an alien hunting down a player. Normally, the AI would just head to the players location and just see them once they enter detection range. What two tier systems do is limit the information flow to the controller AI from the director AI. The director sees all, but it limits what the controller can visualize. Instead of saying, &lt;em&gt;Go to area, find player in location, attack player&lt;/em&gt;, what the controller gets as input is – &lt;em&gt;Go to area and look for player&lt;/em&gt;. The director ai can set the area as anything. But what matters is that the end alien cannot actually see everything that’s happening. What it does is learn from the player in previous encounters. Early on in the game, it might just do a cursory pass around an area and leave, while later on, it might have found the player in a specific location and thus will now check for them in places like it. The alien learns as it goes, and the beauty of this system is that if you select a higher difficulty, then the game can just draw upon cloud data to fill in that early learning steps, dropping in smarter, more intelligent enemies much earlier in the game &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is only possible via big data analysis. Any other solution would mean either massive amounts of very rigid code, or very blatant information cheating. Best example of this is Alien: Isolation a 2014 title by Creative Assembly, that impressed the gaming world with just how scary the AI implementation was. In our opinion this is the best example of a two tier system so far. Systems like this are only possible with big data implementation and the proper ML algorithms. As games advance to more and more realistic worlds, this approach, in our opinion is going to become the norm, since it allows for really flexible systems that are engaging to play around with. However, this isn’t the only way developers can make systems fairer and fun for the end user. Another area where big data is gaining lots of traction is level design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-level-design-and-balance-an-unlikely-big-data-application&#34;&gt;4. Level Design and Balance, An Unlikely Big Data Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When crafting virtual worlds its always difficult to strike a balance between breadth and scope. A common approach is to hand craft levels in games that do not require that much breadth. This approach has great benefits in terms of the attention to detail and depth of narrative, yet crafting each level by hand takes a while. Big data in this case helps with testing, since previously playtesting had players run the map time after time. Now, you can run hundreds of models in addition to the players, compare their paths, and find the best solution for what would increase player enjoyment. However, the main drawback of this approach is its great cost for the developer. Much moreso than just using a script to autogenerate terrain. Some developers will focus entirely on auto-generation as a means of level design instead, which can provide near infinite possibilities for content (see Minecraft), but has the danger of being exceedingly bland to the end user. Big data analytics are a way of alleviating this via looking at what terrain players prefer more, and thus adjusting level generation parameters accordingly. Thus, removing some of the randomness that such worlds depend on.  However, this isn’t the main use of such analytics. A big reason why developers collect massive amounts of data about levels is actually balance issues. This is especially true for Esports titles that dominate the current games markets. Titles where minute advantages in map design get exploited to their fullest extent &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Using data collected from tens of thousands of matches, we can see what paths are most taken, what are optimal firing angles (most esports titles are shooters) and any detail that can give players a leg up over the competition. This allows maps to be fine tuned to produce the most memorable player experiences, feel hand crafted and also be as balanced as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;41-balance&#34;&gt;4.1. Balance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balance isn’t just a competitive thing however, multiplayer games live and die due to balance, as unbalanced gameplay drives away players, leaving only people who are ok with it, which in turn drives away new players &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Ultimately this increases player churn, and you end up with a dead game &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Normally you would just use player feedback, but if you have mountains of raw data, ML and big data can also allow you to really fine tune specific aspects of balance. This isn’t only limited to maps, but also skills, abilities and puzzles. Balance has always been a really fine line between enjoyment and fairness yet it’s the developer’s job to ensure that no one is left out in the cold on purpose.  Some genre’s are more balance intensive and thus require more data to make things fair even when taking into randomness into action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great example are MOBAs, Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas, where being down even 1 player can cause a team to get crushed in a 4v5 matchup. A single person leaving completely changes the dynamic of the game, and without big data its hard to compensate for events like that, since they are at their core, massively unbalanced. But being able to account for literally any situation, allows developers to craft systems that can handle disbalance better in these cases &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
Anything that includes player vs player is very difficult to balance for as well. A good use for big data in this case would be truly fair matchmaking. Currently most systems of this sort use only things like win rate and total playtime, in order to pair up players. However, if we start watching for minute flags on how well players actually play, we can make systems that are specifically made to balance players as much as possible by looking at the minute details of how they actually play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-what-the-future-holds&#34;&gt;5. What the future holds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we can definitely count on is the sheer amount of data that is going to be generated from now on by gaming. With always online experiences being the norm, machines send data reports back to the main system which matches them with other players in the same instance to allow playing in the same world. As more and more players enter the community, we will run into the issue of where an absurdly massive amount of data is being generated, and not all of it is positive. Its going to get harder to get the full picture since now looking over all the data would make the task of sifting through it extremely difficult.
What is most exciting is the developments of self-learning AI based on the mountains of this newfound data. Currently unless you use two tier AI systems, there isn’t a way to make AI believable, and having bad AI can potentially ruin a game for most players. With more advancements in reliable AI systems based on potent data analysis, there exists the potential for AI that is near indistinguishable from players &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-conclusion&#34;&gt;6. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming has gone from a very niche and simple pastime to one of the biggest entertainment markets in the world. From mobile phones, to supercharged desktop setups, the field is expansive to the point where there is something for anyone who wants to have blow a couple of hours behind a screen. The speed at which the field is developing is truly astonishing, and a good portion of it is being driven by the previously discussed Big Data use cases. By being able to use all this data for developmental purposes, game companies and publishers can craft truly memorable and interesting experiences.It has been demonstrated that big data analytics is having some very profound effects on the video game markets from pretty much every side. The end goal of this developemnt is systems that can predict nearly any game situation and adjuist parameters accordingly to maximise player enjoyment. It means, more advanced AI systems that feel as lifelike as humanly possible that can populate virtual worlds. It means systems that can properly react to player inputs in order to create dynamic worlds that aren&amp;rsquo;t just a static canvas that a player is thrust into upon booting up the game. This may seem far off, especially with how a lot of development teams dont exactly use Big Data in the right way, but the best examples are getting quite close in its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since our technology is more and more advanced as time goes by, traditional human-computer interaction has become increasingly difficult to meet people&amp;rsquo;s demands. In this digital era, people need faster and more efficient methods to obtain information and data. Traditional and single input and output devices are not fast and convenient enough, it also requires users to learn their own methods of use, which is extremely inefficient and completely a waste of time. Therefore, artificial intelligence comes out, and its rise has followed the changeover times, and it satisfied people&amp;rsquo;s needs. At the same time, gesture is one of the most important way for human to deliver information. It is simple, efficient, convenient, and universally acceptable. Therefore, gesture recognition has become an emerging field in intelligent human-computer interaction field, with great potential and future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction&#34;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology is probably one of the most attracting things for people nowadays. Whether it is the new iPhone coming out or some random new technology that is bring into our life. It is a matter of fact that technology has become one of the essential parts of our life and our society. Simply, our life will change a lot without technology. As of today, since technology is improving so fast, there are many things that can be related to AI and machine learning. A lot of the ordinary things around our life becomes data. And the reason why they become data is because there is a need for them in having better technology to improve our life. For example, language was stored into data to produce technology like translator to provide convenience for people that does not speak the language. Another example is that roads were stored into data to produce GPS to guide direction for people. Nowadays, people values communication and interaction between others. Since gesture recognition is one of the most important ways to understand people and know their emotion, it becomes a popular field of study for many scientists. There are multiply field of study in gesture recognition and each require a lot of amount of time to know them well. For the report, we do research about hand gesture, body gesture and facial expression. Of course, there will be a lot of other fields related to gesture recognition, for example, like animal gestures. They all can be stored into data and get study in the research by scientists. Many people might have question about how gesture recognition are has anything to do with technology. They simply do not think that they can be related, but in fact, they are related. Companies like Intel and Microsoft have already created so many studies for new technology in that field. For example, Intel proposed combining facial recognition with device recognition to authenticate users. Studying gestures recognition will often reveal what the think. For example, when someone is lying, their eye will tend to look around and they tend to touch their nose with their hand, etc. So, studying gesture recognition will not only help people understand much more about human beings and it can also help our technology grow. For example, in AI and machine learning, studying gestures recognition will make or improve AI and machine learning to better understand humans and be more human-like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-background&#34;&gt;2. Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, people are doing more and more high-tech research, which also makes various high-tech products appear in society. For people, electricity is as important as water and air. Can&amp;rsquo;t imagine life without electricity. We can realize that technology is changing everything about people from all aspects. People living in the high-tech era are also forced to learn and understand the usage of various high-tech products. As a representative of high technology, artificial intelligence has also attracted widespread attention from society. Due to the emergence of artificial intelligence, people have also begun to realize that maintaining human characteristics is also an important aspect of high technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People&amp;rsquo;s living environment is inseparable from high technology. As for the use of human body information, almost every high-tech has different usage &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, face recognition is used in many places to check-in. This kind of technology enables the machine to store the information of the human face and determine whether it is indeed the right person by judging the five senses. We are most familiar with using this technology in airports, customs, and companies to check in at work. Not only that, but the smartphones we use every day are also unlocked through this face recognition technology. Another example is the game console that we are very familiar with. Game consoles such as Xbox and PS already have methods for identifying people&amp;rsquo;s bodies. They can identify several key points of people through the images received by their own cameras, thus inputting this line of action into the world of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many researchers are now studying other applications of human movements, gestures, and facial expressions. One of the most influential ones is that Google’s scientists have developed a new computer vision method for hand perception. Google researchers identified the movement of a hand through twenty-one 3D points on the hand. Research Engineers Valentin Bazarevsky and Fan Zhang stated that &amp;ldquo;The ability to perceive the shape and motion of hands can be a vital component in improving the user experience across a variety of technological domains and platforms &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;rdquo; This model can currently identify many common cultural features. gesture. They have done experiments. When people play a game of &amp;ldquo;rock, paper, scissors&amp;rdquo; in front of the camera, this model can also judge everyone&amp;rsquo;s win or loss by recognizing gestures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than that, many artificial intelligences can now understand people&amp;rsquo;s feelings and intentions by identifying people&amp;rsquo;s facial expressions. This also allows us to know how big a database is behind this to support the operation of these studies. But collecting these data about gesture recognition is not easy. Many times we need to worry about not only whether the data we input is correct, but also whether the target identified by artificial intelligence is clear and the output information is accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-gesture-recognition&#34;&gt;3. Gesture Recognition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gesture recognition is mainly divided into two categories, one is based on external device recognition, the specific application is data gloves, wearing it on user&amp;rsquo;s hand, to obtain and analysis information through sensors. This method has obvious shortcomings, though it is accurate and has excellent response speed, but it is costly and is not good for large-scale promotion. The other one is the use of computer vision. People do not need to wear gloves. As its name implies, this method collects and analyzes information through a computer. It is convenient, comfortable, and not so limited based on external device identification. In contrast, it has greater potential and is more in line with the trend of the times. Of course, this method needs more effective and accurate algorithms to support, because the gestures made by different people at different times, in different environments and at different angles also represent different meanings. So, if we want more accurate information feedback. Then the advancement of algorithms and technology is inevitable. The development of gesture recognition is also the development of artificial intelligence, a process of the development of various algorithms from data gloves to the development of computer vision-based optical technology plays a role in promoting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;31-hand-gesture&#34;&gt;3.1 Hand Gesture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;311-hand-gesture-recognition-and-big-data&#34;&gt;3.1.1 Hand Gesture Recognition and Big Data&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hand gesture recognition is commonly used in gesture recognition because fingers are the most flexible and it is able to create different angles that will represent different meanings. The hand gesture itself is also an easy but efficient way for us human beings to communicate and send messages to each other. The existence of hand gestures can be considered easy but powerful. However, if we are using the application of hand gesture recognition, it is a much more complicated process. In real life, we can just ben our finger or simply make a fist so that other people will understand our message. But when using hand gesture recognition there are many processes that are being involved. Hand gesture is commonly used in geesture recoginitaion As we did our research and based on our life experiences, hand gesture recognition is a very hot topic and has all the potential to be the next wave. Hand gesture recognition has recently achieved big success in many fields. The advancement and development of hand gesture recognition is also the development of other technology such as the advancement of computer chips, the advancement of algorithms, the advancement of machine learning even advancement of deep learning, and the advancement of cameras from 2D to 3D. The most important part of hand gesture recognition is big data and machine learning. Because of the development of big data and machine learning, data scientists are able to have better datasets, build a more accurate and successful model and be able to process the information and predict the most accurate results. Hand gesture recognition is a significant link in Gesture recognition.However gesture recognition is also not only about hand gesture recognition, it also includes other body parts such as facial expression recognition and body gesture recognition. With the help of the whole system of different gesture recognitions, the data can be recorded and processed by AIs. The results or predictions can be used currently or later on for different purposes in different areas &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;312-principles-of-hand-gesture-recognition&#34;&gt;3.1.2 Principles of Hand Gesture Recognition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hand gesture recognition is a complicated process involving many steps. And in order to get the most accurate result, it will need a large amount of quality data and a scientific model with high performance. Hand gesture recognition is also at a developing stage simply because there are so many possible factors that can influence the result. Possible factors include skin color, background color, hand gesture angle, and Bending angle, etc. To simplify the process of gesture recognition, AIs will use 3-D cameras to capture images. After that, the data of the image will be collected and processed by programs and built models.  And lastly, AIs will be able to use that model to get an accurate result in order to have a corresponding response or predict future actions. To explain all processes of hand gesture recognition in detail, it includes graphic gathering, retreatment, skin color segmentation, hand gesture segmentation, and finally hand gesture recognition. Hand Gesture Recognition can not achieve the best accuracy without all any of these steps. Within all these steps, skin color segmentation is the most crucial step in order to increase accuracy and this process will be explained in the next session &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;313-gesture-segmentation-and-algorithm-the-biggest-difficulty-of-gesture-recognition&#34;&gt;3.1.3 Gesture Segmentation and Algorithm, The Biggest Difficulty of Gesture Recognition.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone actually asks us a question which is what kind of recognition is going to have the maximum potential in the future? We will have Hand Gesture recognition as my answer without a doubt. Because in my opinion, Hand Gesture Recognition is really the next wave, as our technology is getting better and better, it will be a much easier and more efficient type of recognition that could possibly change our lives. If you compare Hand Gesture Recognition with Voice Recognition, you will see the biggest difference because everyone is using Hand Gesture all over the world in different ways while Voice is limited to people that are unable to make a sound and sound is a much more complicated type of data that in my opinion is not efficient enough to deliver a message, at least with lots of evidence indicating it is not easier than Hand Gesture Recognition. However, it doesn’t mean hand gesture doesn’t have any limit. Instead, Hand Gesture Recognition is influenced by the color in many ways including skin colors and the colors of the background. But skin color is also a great characteristic of recognition at the same time. So if we could overcome this shortcoming or obstacle, the biggest disadvantage of Hand Gesture Recognition could also become its biggest advantage since skin color has so many amazing characteristics that could be used as a huge benefit for Hand Gesture Recognition. Firstly, skin color is a unique attribute which means it has a similar meaning all over the world. For example, Asian people mostly have yellow skins, Western people mostly have white skins while African American people mostly have black skins. People might form different regions from all over the world but since their skins are similar in many ways, they are most likely to have at least similar hand gesture meanings according to different scientific studies. However, you might ask another realistic question which is what about many people who have similar skin colors but are coming from different groups of people who have a completely different cultural background which results in different Hand Gestures and people who have similar Hands Gesture but have much different skin colors. These are all realistic Hand Gesture Recognition problems and these are the problems that Hand Gesture Recognition already solved or is going to solve in the future. Firstly, for people who have similar skin colors but are coming from different groups of people who have a completely different cultural background, this is when skin color comes to play its role. Even though those people have similar skin color, their skin color can’t be exactly the same. Most of the time, it will be either darker or lighter and we might say it’s all yellow or white, but the machine will see it as its data format so even if it is all white, the type of white is still completely different. And this is when gesture segmentation or more accurately skin color segmentation makes a difference. Overall, us human read skin colors as the simple color we have learned from different textbooks but the computer or machine see the different color in the different color spaces and the data they receive and going to process will be much more accurate. In addition to that, scientists will need to do more in-depth research and studies in order to get the most accurate result. And for people who have similar Hands Gesture but have many different skin colors, scientists will need to collect more accurate data not only about the color and about the size, angles, etc. This more detailed information will help the machine read Hand Gesture more accurately in order to get the most beneficial feedback. The background color will undoubtedly provide lots of useless information and potentially negatively influence the result. In this way, Hand Gesture Recognition has developed its own color and gesture recognition algorithm and method to remove the most useless data or color and leave the valid ones. Lighting in different background settings will have a huge influence to and in most ways, it will negatively influence the result too. There are five most important steps in Hand Gesture Recognition which are Graphic Gathering, Pretreatment, Skin Color Segmentation, Gesture Segmentation, and lastly Gesture Recognition. All these different steps are all very crucial in order to get the most accurate feedback or result. It is pretty similar to the most data treatment process especially the first two steps where you first build a model, gather different types of data, clean the data after that, and use skin color segmentation and gesture segmentation before the last Gesture Recognition process &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;32-body-gesture&#34;&gt;3.2 Body Gesture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;321-introduction-to-body-gesture&#34;&gt;3.2.1 Introduction to Body Gesture&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Body gestures, which can also be called body language, refer to humans expressing their ideas through the coordinated activities of various body parts. In our lives, body language is ubiquitous. It is like a bridge for our human communication. Through body language expression, it is often easier for us to understand what the other person wants to express. At the same time, we can express ourselves better. The profession of an actor is a good example of body language. This is a compulsory course for every actor because actors can only use their performances to let us know what they are expressing &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. At this time, body language becomes extremely important. Different characters have different body movements in different situations, and actors need to make the right body language at a specific time to let the audience know their inner feelings. Yes, the most important point of body language is to convey mood through movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, certain actions will make people feel emotions. For us who communicate with all kinds of people every day, there are also many body languages that we are more familiar with. For example, when a person hangs his head, it means that he is unhappy, walking back and forth is a sign of a person&amp;rsquo;s anxiety, and body shaking is caused by nervousness, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;322-body-gesture-and-big-data&#34;&gt;3.2.2 Body Gesture and Big Data&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a piece of big data, body language requires data collected by studying human movements. Scientists found that when a person wants to convey a complete message, body language accounts for half. And because body language belongs to a person&amp;rsquo;s actions subconsciously, it is rarely deceptive. All of your nonverbal behaviors—the gestures you make, your posture, your tone of voice, how many eyes contact you make—send strong messages &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In many cases, these unconscious messages from our bodies allow the people who communicate with us to feel our intentions. Even when we stop talking, these messages will not stop. This also explains why scientists want to collect data to let artificial intelligence understand human behavior. In order for artificial intelligence to understand human mood or intention from people&amp;rsquo;s body postures and actions, scientists have collected a lot of human body actions that show intentions in different situations through research. The music gesture artificial intelligence developed by MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab is a good example &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The music gesture artificial intelligence developed by MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab can enable artificial intelligence to judge and isolate the sounds of individual instruments through body and gesture movements. This success is undoubtedly created by the big data of the entire body and gestures. The research room collects a large number of human structure actions to provide artificial intelligence with a large amount of information so that the artificial intelligence can judge what melody the musician is playing through body gestures and key points of the face. This can improve its ability to distinguish and separate sounds when artificial intelligence listens to the entire piece of music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the artificial intelligence&amp;rsquo;s analysis of the human body requires facial expressions and body movements. This recognition cannot be achieved only by calculation. What is needed is the collection of the meaning of different body movements of the human body by a large database. The more situations are collected, the more accurate the analysis of human emotions and intentions by artificial intelligence will be. The easiest way is to include more. Just like humans, broadening your horizons is a way to better understand the world. The way of recording actions is not complicated. Just set several key movable joints of the human body to several points, and then connect the red dots with lines to get the approximate shape of the human body. At this time, the actions made by the human body will be included in the artificial intelligence. In the recording process, the upper body and lower body can be recorded separately. In order to avoid in some cases, the existence of obstructions will cause artificial intelligence to fail to recognize correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;323-random-forest-algorithm-in-body-gesture-recognition&#34;&gt;3.2.3 Random Forest Algorithm in Body Gesture Recognition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Body gesture recognition is pretty useful but pretty hard to achieve because of its limitations and harsh requirements. Without the development of all kinds of 3D cameras, body gesture recognition is just an unrealistic dream. In order to get important and precise data for the body gesture recognition to process, different angles, light, background all needs to be captured &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For body gestures, the biggest difficulty is that if you only capture data in the front, it will not give you the correct information and result in most of the time. In this way, you will need precise data from different angles. A Korean team has done an experiment using three 3D cameras and three stereo cameras to capture images and record data from different angles. The data were recorded in a large database that includes captured data both from outside and inside. One of the most popular algorithms used in body gesture recognition is the random forest algorithm. It is very famous and useful in all types of machine learning projects. It is a type of supervised learning algorithm. Because there are all types of data are needed to be a record and process. The random forest algorithm is perfect for that, the biggest advantage of this algorithm is that it can let each individual tree mainly focus on one part or one characteristic of body gesture data because of this algorithm’s ability to combine all weak classifiers into a strong one &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It is simple but so powerful and efficient. In addition to that, it works really well with body gesture recognition. With the algorithm and advanced cameras, precise data could be collected and AIs will be able to get useful information at different levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;33-face-gesture&#34;&gt;3.3 Face Gesture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;331-introduction-to-face-gesture-facial-expression&#34;&gt;3.3.1 Introduction to Face Gesture (Facial Expression)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Body language is one of the ways that we can express ourselves without saying any words. It has been suggested that body language may account for between 60 to 65% of all communication &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. According to expert, body language is used every day for us to communicate with each other. During our communication, we not only use words but also use body gestures, hand gestures and most importantly, we use facial expression most. During communication with different people, our face communicate different thoughts, idea, and emotion and the reason why we use facial expression more than any other body gestures is that when we have certain emotion, it is express in our face automatically. Facial expression is often not under our control. That is why people often say that the word that come out of mouth cannot always be true, but their facial expression will reveal what those people are thinking about. So, what is facial expression exactly? According to Jason Matthew Harley, Facial expressions are configurations of different micromotor movements in the face that are used to infer a person’s discrete emotional state &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Some example of common facial expression will be: Happiness, Sadness, Anger, Surprise, Disgust, Fear, etc &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Each facial expression will have some deep meaning behind it. For example, A simple facial expression like smiling can be translated into a sign of approval, or it can be translated into a sign of friendly. If we put all those emotion into big data, it will help us to understand ourselves much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;332-sense-organs-on-the-face&#34;&gt;3.3.2 Sense Organs on The Face&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facial expression expresses our emotion during the communication by micro movement of our sense organs. The most used organs are the eyes and mouth and sometimes, the eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;3321-eye&#34;&gt;3.3.2.1 Eye&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eyes are one of the most important communication tools in our ways of communication with each other. When we communicate with each other, the eye contact will be inevitable. The signal in your eye will tell people what you are think. 
Eye gaze is a sample of paying attention when communicating with others. When you are talking to a person and if his eye is directly on you and both of you keep having eye contact. In this situation, this mean that he is interested in what you say and is paying attention to what you say. On the other hand, if the action of breaking eye contact happens very frequently, it means that he is not interested, distracted, or not paying attention to you and what you are saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blinking is another eye signal that is very often and will happen in communicating with other people. When talking to other people, blinking is very usual and will happen every time when you are going to communicate with different people. But the frequency of blanking can give away what are you feeling right now. People often blink more rapidly when they are feeling distressed or uncomfortable. Infrequent blinking may indicate that a person is intentionally trying to control his or her eye movements &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, when A person is lying, he might try to control his blinking frequency to make other people feel like he is calm and saying the truth. In order to persuade other people that he is calm and telling the truth, he will need to blink less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pupil size is a very important facial expression. Pupil size can be a very subtle nonverbal communication signal. While light levels in the environment control pupil dilation, sometimes emotions can also cause small changes in pupil size &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, when you are surprised by something, your pupil size will become noticeably larger than before. When having a communication, dilated eyes can also mean that the person is interesting in the communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;3322-mouth&#34;&gt;3.3.2.2 Mouth&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mouth expression and movement will also be a huge part in communicating with other and reading body language. The easiest example will be smiling. A micro movement of your mouth and lip will give signal to others about what do you think or how are you feeling. 
When you tighten your lips, it means that you either distaste, disapprove or distrust other people when having a conversation.
When you bite your lips, it means that you are worried, anxious, or stressed.
When someone tries to hide certain emotional reaction, they tend to cover their mouth in order not to display any facial expression through lip movement. For example, when you are laughing. 
The simple movement of turning up or down of the lip will also indicate what a person is feeling. When the mouth is slightly turn up, it might mean that the person is either feeling happy or optimistic. On the other hand, a slightly down-turned mouth can be an indicator of sadness, disapproval, or even an outright grimace &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;333-facial-expression-and-big-data&#34;&gt;3.3.3 Facial Expression and Big Data&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, since technology is so advance, everything around us can be turn into data and everything can be related to data. Facial expression is often study by different scientist in research because it allows us to understand more about human and communication between different people. One of the relatively new and promising trends in using facial expressions to classify learners&#39; emotions is the development and use of software programs the automate the process of coding using advanced machine learning technologies. For example, FaceReader is a commercially available facial recognition program that uses an active appearance model to model participant faces and identifies their facial expression. The program further utilizes an artificial neural network, with seven outputs to classify learner’s emotions &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Also, facial expression can be analyzed in other software programs like the Computer Expression Recognition Toolbox. Emotion is a huge study field in the technology field, and facial expression is one of the best ways to study and analyze people&amp;rsquo;s emotion. Emotion technology is becoming huge right now and will be even more popular in the future according to MIT Technology Review, Emotion recognition – or using technology to analyze facial expressions and infer feelings-is, by one estimate, set to be a $25 billion business by 2023 &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. So back to the topic about big data and facial expression. Why are those things related? It is because, first everything is data around us. Your facial expression can be stored into data for other to learn and detect too. One of the examples is that, in 2003, The US Transportation Security Administration started training humans to spot potential terrorists by reading their facial expression. And by that, scientist believe that if human can do that, with data and AI technology, robot can detect facial expression more accurate than human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;334-the-problem-with-detecting-emotion-for-technology-nowadays&#34;&gt;3.3.4 The Problem with Detecting Emotion for Technology Nowadays&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though facial expression can reveal people&amp;rsquo;s emotion and what they think, but there has been &amp;ldquo;growing pushback&amp;rdquo; against the statement. A group of scientists brought together a research after reviewing more than 1,000 paper on emotion detection. After the research, the conclusion of it is hard to use facial expressions alone to accurately tell how someone is feeling is made. Human&amp;rsquo;s mind is very hard to predict. People do not always cry when they feel down and smile when they feel happy. The facial expression can not always reveal the true feeling the person is feeling. Not only that, because there is not enough data for facial expression, people will often mistakenly categorize other&amp;rsquo;s facial expression. For example, Kairos, which is a facial biometrics company, promise retailers that it can use a emotion recognition technology to figure out how their customers are feeling. But when they are labeling the data to feed the algorithm, one big problem reveals. An observer might read a facial expression as &amp;ldquo;surprised,&amp;rdquo; but without asking the original person, it is hard to know what the real emotion was &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. So the problems with technology that involves around facial expression are first, there is not enough data. Second is that facial expression sometimes can not be always true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;335-classification-algorithms&#34;&gt;3.3.5 Classification Algorithms&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, since technology is growing so fast, there are a lot of interaction between humans and computer. Facial expression plays an essential role in social interaction with other people. It is not arguably one of the best ways to understand human. &amp;ldquo;It is reported that facial expression constitutes 55% of the effect of a communicated message while language and voice constitute 7% and 38% respectively. With the rapid development of computer vision and artificial intelligence, facial expression recognition becomes the key technology of advanced human computer interaction &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;rdquo; This quote from the research shows that facial expression is one of the main tools that we are using to communicate with other people and interact with computer. So being able to recognize and identify the facial expression becomes relatively important. The main objective for facial expression recognitions is to use its conveying information automatically and correctly. As a result, feature extraction is very important to the facial expression recognition process. The process needs to be smooth and without any mistakes. So, algorithms are needed in the processes. Classification analysis is an important component of facial recognition, it is mainly used to find data distribution that is valuable and at the same time, find data models in the potential data. At present it has further study of the database, data mining, statistics, and other fields &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition to that, one of the major obstacles and limitation of facial expression recognition is face detection. To detect the face, you will need to locate the faces in an image or a photograph. This is where scientists applicate classification algorithm, machine learning and deep learning. Recently, convolutional neural network model has become so successful that facial recognition is the next top wave &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-conclusion&#34;&gt;4. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the development of artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, big data, and machine learning even deep learning is getting more mature. Gesture Recognition including Hand Gesture Recognition, Body Gesture Recognition, and Face Gesture Recognition has finally come true into a real-life application and already achieved huge success in many areas. But it still has much more potential in all possible areas that could change people&amp;rsquo;s lives drastically in a good way. Gestures are the simplest and the most natural language of all human beings. It sends the clearest message for communicating between people, and even human and computers. Because of the more powerful cameras, better big data technology, and more efficient and effective algorithms from deep learning, Scientists are able to use color and the Gesture Segmentation method to remove useless color data in order to maximize the accuracy of the result. As we are doing our research, we also find out Hand Gesture Recognition is not the only Recognition in this area, Body Gesture Recognition and Face Gesture Recognition or facial expression are also very important, they can also deliver messages in the simplest way. They are also very effective when building relationships between humans and machines. Face Gesture or facial expression could not only deliver messages but even deliver emotions. Micromovements of facial expressions studied by different scientists could be very useful in predicting the emotions of humans. Body Gesture Recognition is also helpful as we did our research with the body gesture data scientists collected from different musicians with different instruments. They are able to predict the melodies or even the songs played by that musician. This is mind-blowing because with this type of technology and applications we are able to achieve more and use it in many possible fields. With all these combined, scientists could build a very successful and mature Gesture Recognition model to get the most accurate result or prediction. According to the research and our own analysis, we come up with a conclusion that Gesture Recognition will be the next hot trendy topic and are applicable in many possible areas including Security, AI, economics, manufacture, the game industry, and even medical services. With Gesture Recognition being applied, scientists are able to develop much smarter AIs and machines that can interact with humans more efficiently and more fluently. AIs will be able to receive and understand messages from humans more easily and will able to function better. This is also a great message for many handicapped people. With Hand Gesture Recognition being used, their life will also be easier and happier and that’s definitely something we are want to see because the overall goal of all the technologies is to make people&amp;rsquo;s life easier and bring the greatest amount of happiness to the greatest amount of people. However, the technology we have right now is not advanced enough yet, in order to get a more accurate result, we still need to develop better cameras, better algorithms, and better models. But we all believe that this era is the big data era, and everything could happen as big data and deep learning technology get more and more advanced and mature. We believe in and look forward to the beautiful future of Gesture Recognition. And we also think people should really pay more and closer attention to this field since Gesture Recognition is the next wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare is an organized provision of medical practices provided to individuals or a community. Over centuries the application of innovative healthcare has been needed increasingly as humans expand their life span and become more aware of better preventative care practices. The application of Big Data within the industry of Healthcare is of the utmost importance in order to quantify the effects of wide scale efficient and safe solutions. Pharmaceutical and Bio Data Research companies can use big data to intake large facets of patient record data and use this collected data to iterate how preventative care can be implemented before diseases actually present themselves in stages that are beyond the point of potential recovery. Data collected in laboratory settings and statistics collected from medical and state institutions of healthcare facilitate time, money, and life saving initiatives as deep learning can in certain instances perform better than the average doctor at detecting malignant cells. Big data within healthcare has proven great results for the advancement and diverse application of informed reasoning towards medical solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords:&lt;/strong&gt; EHR, Healthcare, diagnosis, application, treatment, AI, network, records&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1--introduction&#34;&gt;1.  Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare is a multi-dimensional system established with the aim of the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of health-related issues or impairments in human beings&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The many dimensions of Healthcare can be characterized by the influx of information coming and going from each level as there are multiple different applications of Healthcare. These applications can include but are not limited to vaccines, surgeries, x-rays, medicines/treatments. Big data plays a pivotal role in Healthcare diagnostics, predictions, and accelerated results/outcomes of these applications. Big Data has the ability to save millions of dollars through automating 40% of radiologist’s tasks, saving time on potential treatments through digital patients, and by providing improved outcomes&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. With higher accuracy rates of diagnosis and advanced AI is able to transform hypothetical analysis into data driven diagnosis and treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-patient-records&#34;&gt;2. Patient Records&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EHR stands for &amp;lsquo;electronic health records&amp;rsquo; and is a digital version of a patient’s paper chart.The Healthcare industry utilizes EHR for maintaining records of everything related in their institutions. EHR are real-time, patient centred records that make information available instantly and securely to authorized users&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. EHR is capable of holding even more information as it is possible to include such information such as medical history, diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, and laboratory and test results. According to Definitive Healthcare data from 2020, more than 89 percent of all hospitals have implemented inpatient or ambulatory EHR systems &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A network of information surrounding a patient&amp;rsquo;s health record and medical data allows for the research and production of such progressive advancement in treatment. To underline the potential of the resources, more than 110 million EHRs around the continents were inspected for genetic disease research&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is the capability of EHRs as it holds information capable of diagnosing, preventing and treating other patients for early detection of an ailment or disease. Through the application of neural networks in Deep Learning models, EHR’s could be compiled and analyzed to identify inconspicuous indicators of disease development of patients in early stages far before a human doctor would be able to make a clear diagnosis. The application has the ability to work far ahead for preventive measures as well as the allocation of resources to make sure that patients are paying for the care at minimum costs, the appropriate method of medical intervention is applied, and physicians’ workload can become less strenuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;21-ehr-application-detecting-error-and-reducing-costs&#34;&gt;2.1 EHR Application: Detecting Error and Reducing Costs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to understand the impact that Big Data such as EHRs has on the Healthcare industry an example of research is presented in the form of collection before and after implementation of EHR. The research study collected data for the period of 1 year before EHR (pre-EHR) and 1 year after EHR (post-EHR) implementation. What was noticed in the analyzes of the data was in the area of &amp;lsquo;Medication errors and near misses&amp;rsquo; the research stated &amp;lsquo;medication errors per 1000 hospital days decreased 14.0%-from 17.9% in the pre-EHR period to 15.4% in the 9 months after CPOE implementation&amp;rsquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The research determined that with implementation of EHR with (CPOE) computerized provider order entry was able to reduce the costs of treatment and improvised upon the safety of their patients. Participants of the study mentioned that there was an increase in speed when it came to pharmacy, laboratory and radiology orders. The research also stated &amp;lsquo;our study demonstrated an 18% reduction in laboratory testing&amp;rsquo;. The study touched upon the rapidness that EHR can add to a process of treatment when orders are validated much quicker and hospitals and patients save money from the rapid diagnosis and treatment. This cuts out the middle-man of deliberate testing and examinations upon patients so they don’t have to cover the costs or undergo wasteful testing from their own EHR and other extensive EHR that it utilizes for comparison. Examples of models used in this example study include data mining through phenotyping and natural language processing. In this way data mining allows large sets of patient data to be aggregated in order to make inferences over a population or theories regarding how a disease will progress in any given patient. Phenotyping categorizes features of patients&#39; health and their DNA and ultimately their overall health. Association rule data mining helps automated systems in their predictions  in order to predict behavioral and health outcomes of patients’ circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-ai-models-in-cancer-detection&#34;&gt;3. AI Models in Cancer Detection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI is modifying early detection of cancer as models are capable of being more accurate and precise with the analysis of mass and cell images. The difficulty of diagnosing cancer is because of the possibilities of either the mass being benign or malignant. The amount of time overlooking the cell nuclei and its features to either determine if it is malignant or benign can be staggering for oncologists. Utilizing the information of what&amp;rsquo;s known about cancer can train AI to be calibrated to scour through several images and screenings of cell nuclei to find the key indicators. These key indicators can also be whittled down even further as there is AI to determine which indicators have the highest correlation with malignant cancer. As a dataset from Kaggle consisting of 569 cases of malignant and benign breast cancer, it represented 357 cases of benign and 212 of malignant. With that information there were initially 33 features that may have indicated malignancy in these cases. The 33 features were reduced to 10 features as not all of them equally displayed the same level of contribution to the diagnosis. Across the 10 features there were 5 features that demonstrated the highest correlation to the malignancy. Several models were adapted to find the highest accuracy and precision. This form of AI detection improves upon the efficacy of early cancer detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-352/raw/main/report/images/aimodels.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;AI Models Demonstrate Accuracy &amp; Precision&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/strong&gt; Demonstrates how AI in this study used images to cross-analyze features of a patient&amp;rsquo;s results to verify what model is the most accurate and precise to determine which model can best serve a physician in their diagnostic report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;31-early-detection-big-data-applications&#34;&gt;3.1 Early Detection Big Data Applications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;An ounce of prevention is worth more than a pound of a cure&amp;rsquo; is a common philosophy held by medical professionals. The meaning behind this ideology is found in that if one can prevent a disease from ever taking its final form through performing small routine tasks and check ups, a plethora of harm and suffering from trying to recage a disease can be avoided. Many medical solutions for diseases such as cancer or degenerative brain diseases rely on the idea that outside medical intervention will strengthen the patient enough for the human body to heal itself through existing biological principles &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, vaccines work by injecting dead cells into a patient so that its antibodies can be learned and immunity can be built up by white blood cells naturally. Intervening before one is infected must be completed for these measures to be effective. If preventative care such as routine screenings on individuals with family history of diseases or those with general genetic predispositions then the power truly lies in having the discernment knowledge to catch the disease early. In many diseases once a patient is presenting symptoms, it is too late or survival/recovery probability percentages are slashed. This places immense pressures on patients themselves to work to have access to routine screenings and even more pressure on physicians to intake these patients and make preliminary diagnosis with little more than a visual analysis of the patient. Big data automates these tasks and gives physicians an incredible advantage and discernment as to what is truly happening within a patient’s circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;32-detecting-cervical-cancer&#34;&gt;3.2 Detecting Cervical Cancer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cervical cancer in the past was one of the most common causes of cancer death for women in the United States. However preventive care in the form of pap test has been able to drop the death rate significantly. In the pap test images are taken of the women’s cervix to identify any changes that might indicate cancer is going to form. Cervical cancer has a much higher death rate without early detection as a cure is easier to take full effect in the early stages. Artificial Intelligence performs an algorithm and gives the computer the ability to act and reason based on a set of known information. Machine learning implements more data and allows the computer to work iteratively and make predictions and make decisions based on the massive amount of data provided. In this way, machines have had the ability to detect cervical cancer with greater precision and accuracy in some cases than gynecologists &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Imaging of cervical screenings targeted by a convolution neural network is the key to unlocking correlations behind the large sum of images. By implementing further reasoning into the data set, the CNN is able to  classify enhanced recognition of cancer as or before it forms. This study using this method of machine learning has been able to perform with 90-96% accuracy and save lives. The CNN is able to identify the colors, shapes, sizes, edges and other features pertaining to cancerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is ground breaking for women in underdeveloped countries like India and Nigeria where the death rate for cervical cancer is much higher than the United States due to lack of access to routine pap smears. Women could get results on their cervical cancer status even if they do not get a pap smear every 3 years as recommended by doctors. For example if a woman in Nigeria has her first pap smear at the age of 40 when the recommended age to start pap smears is 21 she has gone unchecked for nearly 20 years and the early detection window is narrowed. However, if she is one of the 20% of women who get cervical cancer over the age of 65, a deep learning analysis of her pap smear at 40 could save her life and roadblock potential suffering. Early detection is key and big data optimizes early detection windows by providing a deeper analysis in the preventive care stages. From here doctors are able to implement the best care plan available on a case by case basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-artificial-intelligence-in-cardiovascular-disease&#34;&gt;4. Artificial intelligence in Cardiovascular Disease&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI in cardiovascular disease models are innovating disease detection by segmenting different types of analysis together for more efficient and accurate results. Being that cardiovascular diseases typically agitate/involve the heart and lungs there are numerous dynamics surrounding why a person is experiencing certain symptoms or at risk for development of a more critical diagnosis. Immense amount of labor is included in the diagnosis and treatment of individuals with cardiovascular disease on behalf of general physicians, specialists, nurses, and several other medical professionals. Artificial intelligence has the capability to add a layer of ease and accuracy that is involved in analyzing a patient&amp;rsquo;s status or risk for cardiovascular disease. AI is able to overcome the challenges of low quality pixelated images from analyzes and draw clearer and more accurate conclusions at a stage where more prevention strategies can be implemented. AI in this sense is able to analyze the systems of the human body as a whole as opposed to a doctor which might have several appointments with a patient to determine results from evaluations on lungs, heart, etc. By segmenting x-rays from numerous patients AI is able to learn and grow its data set to produce increasingly accurate and precise results[^8].
By using a combination of recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks artificial intelligence is able to go beyond what currently exists in terms of medical analysis and provide optimum results for patients in need. Recurrent neural networks function by building upon past data in order to create new output in series. They work hand in hand with Convolutional Neural networks which focus on analyzing advanced imagery based on qualitative data and can weigh biases on potential prescriptive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-352/raw/main/report/images/cardioai.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;AI Learning Wireframe&#34;&gt;[^10]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.&lt;/strong&gt; Demonstrates a wireframe of how data is computed to draw relevant conclusions from thousands of images and pinpoint exact predictions of diagnosis. Risk analysis is crucial for heart attack prevention and understanding how suspeectable a person is to heart failure. Being that heart attacks can lead to strokes due to loss of blood and oxygen to the brain, these imaging tools serve as an invaluable life saving mechanism to help bring prevention to the forefront of these medical emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-deep-learning-techniques-for-genomics&#34;&gt;5. Deep Learning Techniques for Genomics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A digital patient is the idea that a patient’s health record can be compiled with live and exact biometrics for the purpose of testing. Through this method medical professionals will have the ability to propose new solutions to patients and monitor potential effects of operations or medicines over a period of time in a condensed/rapid results format. Essentially if a patient would be able to see how their body reacts to medical procedures before they are performed. The digital copy of a patient would receive simulated trial treatments to better understand what would happen over a period of time if the solution was adopted. For example, a patient would be able to verify with their physician what type of diuretics, beta inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blocker medication would be the most effective solution to their hypertension regulatory needs[^11]. Physicians would be able to mitigate the risks and side effects associated with a certain solution given a patients expected behavior in response to what has been uploaded to the model.
In order to produce deep learning results, models must be implemented by indicating genetic markers by which computational methods can traverse the genetics strands and draw relevant conclusions. In this way data can be processed to propose changes to disease carrying chains of DNA or fortify immune based responses in those who are immunocompromised[^9].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-352/raw/main/report/images/genomics.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;Genomics Illustration&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3.&lt;/strong&gt;  Illustrates how genes are analyzed through data collection methods such as EHR, personal biometric data, and family history in order to track what type of disease poses a threat and how to prevent, predict, and treat disease at the molecular level. Producing accurate methods of treatments, medications as well as predictions without having to put the patient through any trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-discussion&#34;&gt;6. Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In considering the numerous innovations made possible by Big Data one can expect major impacts on society as we know it. Access to these types of data solutions should be made accessible to all those who are in need. Collectively an effort must be made to promote equitable access to life saving artificial intelligence discussed in this report. Processing  power and lack of resources stand as a barrier to widespread access to proper testing. However, governments and industries in the private sector must work together to avoid monopolies and price gouging limitations to such valuable data and computing models.
With further investment into deep learning models error margins can be narrowed and risk percentages and be slimmed pertaining to prescriptive analysis in specific use cases. The more access to information and examples are available, the better and more advanced a deep learning system can become. With the addition of electronic health records and past analysis artificial intelligence has the power to exponentially revolutionize the healthcare industry. By providing patients with services that could save their lives there is more incentive to stay involved in personal health as computation is optimized targeting patients for more results focused visits to the doctor. Doctors themselves are able to be relieved of a portion of the workload and foster a greater work life balance through cutting down on testing time and having more time to interact with patients for educational informative appointments. Legally medical professionals will be able to use prediction errors as alternative signals to further analyze a patient and justify treatment measures. Using data visualization of potential outcomes via a specific treatment method will empower patients and doctors to choose the pathway with the most favorable outcome.Convolutional Neural Networks within deep learning is one of the if not the most essential form of algorithm for AI in healthcare. CNN allows images to be input in a way that allows for learnable weights and biases to be calculated for and differentiate and match aspects of images that would go unknown to the human eye. Through identifying the edges, shape, size, color, amount of scarring CNN is able to identify cancerous and non-cancerous cells into five categories: normal, mild, moderate, severe, and carcinoma. Accuracy in this space is above 95% and creates a new opportunity space for medical professionals to provide their patients with a high level of accuracy and timely action planning for treatment and recovery[^13]. Beyond human healthcare CNN modeling has the potential to transfer into the realm of veterinary medicine, agricultural engineering, and sustainable environment initiatives to detect invasive species and similar disease development. Dogs or cats with cancer or heart worm could be analyzed in order to determine that with their heredity/breed and life span what are the chances and timeline for disease development. Crop production could be amplified with the processing of plant genomes in combination with soil to foresee what combination will produce the most abundant and profitable harvest. Lastly, ecosystems distrubed by global warming have the capability of being studied with CNN in order to factor in changes to the environment and what solutions could be on the horizon. With enough sample collection the power of CNN has the capability of securing a brighter future for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;7-conclusion&#34;&gt;7. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare is an essential resource to living a long life and without it we can see our lifespan slashed nearly in half or even more for those who are hindered by hereditary ailments. Healthcare has been around as long as medicine and such other treatments have been around and that was centuries ago. The field has expanded well beyond what could’ve been expected for any medical professional or institution. Where the information and resources are available to save and care for the life before them even when a lack of training can hinder them the resources are present. It&amp;rsquo;s come to be such an accomplishment to mesh the medical practices of many medical professionals and Big Data to develop the largest compendium of medical practices in the world. By the allowance of such an asset many are able to collaborate with new findings and reinforcing old findings as these prevalent results allow physicians to work without faltering over inconclusive findings. The goal for this area of Big Data is to continue making the EHR system more secure and friendly towards medical professionals in different areas of practice as well as allowing easy access for patients who seek out their own medical history. The more advancements in this area of Healthcare can be applicable to other fields that must reference the compendium that maintains individuals and their history going forward. Such a structure will continue to aid generations of physicians and patients alike and can aid technological advancements along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music analysis on an individual level is incredibly subjective. A particular song can leave polarizing impressions on the emotions of its listener. One person may find a sense of calm in a piece, while another feels energy. In this study we examine the audio and lyrical features of popular songs in order to find relationships in a song&amp;rsquo;s lyrics, audio features, and its valence. We take advantage of the audio data provided by Spotify for each song in their massive library, as well as lyrical data from popular music news and lyrics site, Genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction&#34;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall mood of a musical piece is generally very difficult to decipher due to the highly subjective nature of music. One person might think a song is energetic and happy, while another may think it is quite sad. This can be attributed to varying interpretations of tone and lyrics in song between different listeners. In this project we study both the audio and lyrical patterns of a song through machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to find a relationship between the song&amp;rsquo;s lyrics and its valence, or its overall positivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-related-work&#34;&gt;2. Related Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies take three different ways in classifying the mood of a song according to various mood models by analyzing audio, analyzing lyrics, and analyzing lyrics and audio. Most of these studies have been successful in their goals but have uses a limited collection of songs/words for their analysis &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Perhaps obviously, the best results come when combining audio and lyrics. A simple weighting is given by a study from the University of Illinois to categorize moods of a song by audio and lyrical content analysis, A simple weighting is given by a study from the University of Illinois to categorize moods of a song by audio and lyrical content analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;phybrid = \alpha plyrics + (1 - \alpha )paudio&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When researching existing work, we found two applications that approach music recommendations based on mood, one is called &amp;lsquo;moooodify&amp;rsquo;, a free web application developed by an independent music enthusiast, Siddharth Ahuja &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Another website, Organize Your Music, aims to organize a Spotify user&amp;rsquo;s music library based on mood, genre, popularity, style, and other categories &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, both of these applications do not seem to take into account any lyrical analysis of a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyrics of a song can be used to learn a lot about music from lexical pattern analysis to gender, genre, and mood analyses. For example, in an individual study a researcher found that female artists tend to mention girls, women, and friends a lot, while male artists sing about late Saturday Nights, play and love &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Another popular project, SongSim, used repetition to visualize the parts of a song &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Findings such as these can be used to uncover the gender of an artist based on their lyrics. Similarly, by use of NLP tools, lyrical text can be analyzed to elicit the mood and emotion of a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-datasets&#34;&gt;3. Datasets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the audio content analysis portion of this project, we use Spotify&amp;rsquo;s Web API, which provides a great amount audio data for every song in Spotify&amp;rsquo;s song collection, including valence, energy, and danceability &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the lyrical analysis portion of this project, we use Genius&amp;rsquo;s API to pull lyrics information for a song. Genius is a website where users submit lyrics and annotations to several popular songs &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. To perform sentiment analysis on a set of lyrics collected from Genius, we use the NLTK Vader library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-analysis&#34;&gt;4. Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this study, we analyze a track&amp;rsquo;s lyrics and assign them scores based on their positivity, negativity, and neutrality. We then append this data to the audio feature data we receive from Spotify. To compare and find relationships and meaningfulness in using lyrics and audio features to predict a song&amp;rsquo;s valence, we employ several statistical and machine learning approaches. We try linear regression and polynomial regression to find relationships between several features of a track and a song&amp;rsquo;s valence. Then we perform multivariate linear regression to find how accurately we can predict a song&amp;rsquo;s valence based on the audio and lyrical features available in our dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;41-accumulation-of-audio-features-and-lyrics&#34;&gt;4.1 Accumulation of audio features and lyrics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our data sources, we collected data for roughly 10000 of the most popular songs released between 2017 and 2020, taking account of several audio and lyrical features present in the track. We gathered this data by hand, first querying the most popular 2000 newly released songs in each year between 2017 and 2020. We then sent requests to Genius to gather lyrics for each song. Some songs, even though they were popular, did not have lyrics present on Genius, these songs were excluded from our dataset. With BeautifulSoup, we extracted and cleaned up the lyrics, removing anything that is not a part of the song&amp;rsquo;s lyrics like annotations left by users, section headings (Chorus, Hook, etc), and empty lines. After exclusions our data covered 6551 Spotify tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;42-performance-of-sentiment-analysis-on-lyrics&#34;&gt;4.2 Performance of sentiment analysis on lyrics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a song&amp;rsquo;s lyrics in hand, we used NLTK&amp;rsquo;s sentiment module, Vader, to read each line in the lyrics. NLTK Vader Sentiment Intensity Analyzer is a pretrained machine learning model that reads a line of text and assigns it scores of positivity, negativity, neutrality, and and overall compound score. We marked lines with a compound score greater than 0.5 as positive, less than -0.1 as negative, and anything in between as neutral. We then found the percentages of positive, negative, and neutral lines in a song&amp;rsquo;s composition and saved them to our dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a brief analysis of the legibility of the Vader module in determining sentiment on four separate strings. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m happy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m so happy&amp;rdquo; were used to compare two positive lines, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m happy&amp;rdquo; was expected to have a positive compound score, but slightly less positive than &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m so happy&amp;rdquo;. Similarly, we used two negative lines &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sad&amp;rdquo; and the slightly more extreme, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m so sad&amp;rdquo; which were expected to result in negative compound scores with &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sad&amp;rdquo; being less negative than &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m so sad&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Scores for &#39;I&#39;m happy&#39;: {
    &#39;neg&#39;: 0.0, 
    &#39;neu&#39;: 0.213, 
    &#39;pos&#39;: 0.787, 
    &#39;compound&#39;: 0.5719
}

Scores for &#39;I&#39;m so happy&#39;: {
    &#39;neg&#39;: 0.0, 
    &#39;neu&#39;: 0.334, 
    &#39;pos&#39;: 0.666, 
    &#39;compound&#39;: 0.6115
}

Scores for &#39;I&#39;m sad&#39;: {
    &#39;neg&#39;: 0.756, 
    &#39;neu&#39;: 0.244, 
    &#39;pos&#39;: 0.0, 
    &#39;compound&#39;: -0.4767
}

Scores for &#39;I&#39;m so sad&#39;: {
    &#39;neg&#39;: 0.629, 
    &#39;neu&#39;: 0.371, 
    &#39;pos&#39;: 0.0, 
    &#39;compound&#39;: -0.5256
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these results confirmed our expectations, a few issues come to the table with our use of the Vader module. One is that Vader takes into consideration additional string features such as punctuation in its determination of score, meaning &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m so sad!&amp;rdquo; will be more negative than &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m so sad&amp;rdquo;. Since lyrics on Genius are contributed by the community, in most cases there is a lack of consistency using accurate punctuation. Additionally, in some cases there can be typos present in a line of lyrics, both of which can skew our data. However we determined that our method in using the Vader module is suitable for our project as we simply want to determine if a track is positive or negative without needing to be too specific. Another issue is that our implementation of Vader acts only on English words. Again, since lyrics on Genius are contributed by the community, there could be errors in our data from misspelled word contributions as well as sections or entire lyrics written in different languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to performing sentiment analysis on the lyrics, we tokenized the lyrics, removing common words such as &amp;lsquo;a&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;the&amp;rsquo;,&amp;lsquo;for&amp;rsquo;, etc. This was done to collect data on the number of meaningful and number of non-repeating words in each song. Albeit while this data was never used in our study, it could prove useful in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table 1&lt;/em&gt; displays a snapshot of the data we collected from seven tracks released in 2020. The dataset contains 27 fields, 12 of which describe the audio features of a track, and 8 of which describe the lyrics of the track. For the purpose of this study we exclude the use of audio features key, duration, and time signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;43-description-of-select-data-fields&#34;&gt;4.3 Description of select data fields&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following terms defined are important in our analyses. In our data set most terms contain are represented by a value between 0 and 1, indicating least to most. For example, looking at the first two rows in &lt;em&gt;Table 1&lt;/em&gt;, we can see that the track by the artist, Pop Smoke, has a greater speechiness score, indicating a greater percentage of that song contains spoken word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danceability:&lt;/strong&gt; uses several musical elements (tempo, stability, beat strength, regularity) to determine how suitable a given track is for dancing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy:&lt;/strong&gt;  measures intensity of a song&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loudness:&lt;/strong&gt; a songs overall loudness measured in decibels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speechiness:&lt;/strong&gt; identifies how much of a track contains spoken word&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acousticness:&lt;/strong&gt; confidence of a track being acoustic, or with physical instruments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instrumentalness:&lt;/strong&gt; confidence of a track having no vocals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liveness:&lt;/strong&gt; confidence of a track being a live recording&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valence:&lt;/strong&gt; predicts the overall happiness, or positivity of a track based on its musical features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tempo:&lt;/strong&gt; the average beats per minute of a track&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positivity:&lt;/strong&gt; percentage of lines in a track&amp;rsquo;s lyrics determined to have a positive sentiment score&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negativity:&lt;/strong&gt; percentage of lines in a track&amp;rsquo;s lyrics determined to have a negative sentiment score&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neutrality:&lt;/strong&gt; percentage of lines in a track&amp;rsquo;s lyrics determined to have a neutral sentiment score&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of these fields, we seek to find which audio features correlate to a song&amp;rsquo;s valence and if our positivity and negativity scores of a song&amp;rsquo;s lyrics provide any meaningfulness in determining a song&amp;rsquo;s positivity. For the purpose of this study we mainly focus on valence, energy, danceability, positivity, and negativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;44-preliminary-analysis-of-data&#34;&gt;4.4 Preliminary Analysis of Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When calculating averages of the feature fields captured in our dataset, we found it interesting that based on our lyrical interpretation, tracks between 2017 and 2020 tended to be more negative than positive. The average negativity score for a track in our dataset was 0.21 which means 21% of the lines in the track were deemed to have negative connotation, while having a 0.08 positivity score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-341/raw/main/project/images/all_tracks_heatmap.png&#34; alt=&#34;Heatmap&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Heatmap of data with fields valence, energy, danceability, positivity, negativity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backed by &lt;em&gt;Figure 1&lt;/em&gt;, we find that track lyrics tend to be more negative than positive. However for the most part, even with tracks with negative lyrics, the valence, or overall happiness of the audio features hovers around 0.5; indicating that most songs tend to have neutral audio features. Looking at tracks with lyrics that are highly positive we find that the valence rises to about 0.7 to 0.8 and that songs with extremely high negatively also cause the valence to drop to the 0.3 range. These observations indicate that only extremes in lyrical sentiment correlate significantly in a song&amp;rsquo;s valence, as some songs with negative lyrics may also be fast-tempo and energetic, keeping the valence relatively high compared to lyrical composition. This is shown in our visualization, where both tracks with positive and negative lyricals have high energy and danceability values, indicating fast-tempos and high-pitches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;45-scatterplot-analysis&#34;&gt;4.5 Scatterplot Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-341/raw/main/project/images/audio_features_scatterplots.png&#34; alt=&#34;Audio_Features_Scatterplots&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Scatterplots showing relation of features danceability, energy, speechiness, positivity, negativity, and neutrality to valence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2&lt;/em&gt; describes the relation of several data fields we collected to a song&amp;rsquo;s valence, or its overall positivity. We find that the positivity and negativity plots reflect that of the speechiness plot in that there seems to be little correlation between the x and y axes. On the other hand neutrality seems to show a positive correlation between a song&amp;rsquo;s lyrical content and its respective valence. If a song is more neutral, it seems more likely to have a higher valence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-341/raw/main/project/images/spotify_distributions.png&#34; alt=&#34;Spotify Distributions&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Distributions of field values across the Spotify music library &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our scatterplots do show consistency with the expected distributions exemplified in the Spotify API documentation, as shown in &lt;em&gt;Figure 3&lt;/em&gt;. In the top three plots, which use values for audio features obtained exclusively obtained from the audio features given by Spotify, we can see the these matching distributions which imply that most songs fall in the 0.4 to 0.8 range for danceability, energy, and valence, and 0 to 0.1 for speechiness. The low distribution in speechiness can be explained by music features being more dependant on instruments and sounds than spoken word. A track with higher than 0.33 speechiness score indicates that the track is very high in spoken word content over music, like a poetry recitation, talk show clip, etc &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;46-linear-and-polynomial-regression-analyses&#34;&gt;4.6 Linear and Polynomial Regression Analyses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a simple linear regression test against valence with the audio and lyrical features described in &lt;em&gt;Figure 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Figure 3&lt;/em&gt;. Like the charts show, it was hard to find any linear correlation between the fields. &lt;em&gt;Table 2&lt;/em&gt; displays the r-squared results that we obtained when applying linear regression to find the relationship between a song&amp;rsquo;s feature and its valence. The only features that indicate potential relationships with a song&amp;rsquo;s valence are energy, and danceability, as definitions of energy and and danceability indicate some semblance of positivity as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table 2:&lt;/strong&gt; R-Squared results obtained from linear regression application on select fields against valence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;0.066492856&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we found little relation between the selected features and valence, we tried applying polynomial regression with the same features as shown in &lt;em&gt;Table 3&lt;/em&gt;. Again, we failed to find any relationship between a feature in our dataset and the song&amp;rsquo;s valence. Energy and danceability once again were found to have the highest relationship with valence. We speculate that some of the data we have is misleading the regression applications; as mentioned before, we found some issues in reading sentiment in the lyrics we collected due to misspelled words, inaccurate punctuations, and non-english words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table 3:&lt;/strong&gt; R-Square results obtained from polynomial regression application on select data fields against valence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;47-multivariate-regression-analysis&#34;&gt;4.7 Multivariate Regression Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed multivariate regression tests to predict a song&amp;rsquo;s valence with a training set of 5500 tracks and a test set of 551 tracks. Our first test only included four independent variables: neutrality, energy, danceability, and speechiness. Our second test included all numerical fields available in our data, adding loudness, acousticness, liveness, instrumentalness, tempo, positivity, word count, and unique word count to the regression coefficient calculations. In both tests we calculated the relative mean squared error (RMSE) between our predicted values and the actual values of a song&amp;rsquo;s valence given several features. Our RMSEs were 0.1982 and 0.1905 respectively, indicating that as expected, adding additional pertinent independent variables gave slightly better results. However given that a song&amp;rsquo;s valence is captured between 0 and 1.0, and both our RSMEs were approximately 0.19, it is unclear how significant the results of these tests are. &lt;em&gt;Figure 4&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Figure 5&lt;/em&gt; show the calculated differences between the predicted and actual values for the first 50 tracks in our testing dataset for each regression test respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table 4&lt;/em&gt; displays the benchmarks we received from key parts of our analyses. As expected, creating our dataset took a longer amount of time relative to the rest of the benchmarks. This is because accumulating the data involved sending two requests to online sources, and running the sentiment intensity analyzer on the lyrics received from the Genius API calls. Getting the sentiment of a line of text itself did not take much time at all. We found it interesting that applying multivariate regression on our dataset was much quicker than calculating averages on our dataset with numpy, and that it was the fastest process to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-conclusion&#34;&gt;6. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We received inconclusive results from our study. The linear and polynomial regression tests that we performed, showed little correlation between our lyrical features and a track&amp;rsquo;s valence. This was backed by our multivariate regression test which performed with a RSME score of about 0.19 on our dataset. Since valence is recorded on a scale from 0 to 1.0, this means that our predictions typically fall within 20% of the actual value, which is considerably inaccurate. As previous studies have shown massive improvements in combining lyrical and audio features for machine learning applications in music, we believe that the blame for our low scores falls heavily on our approach to assigning sentiment scores on our lyrics &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Future studies should consider the presence of foreign lyrics and the potential inaccuracies of community submitted lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several other elements of this study that could be improved upon in future iterations. In this project we only worked with songs released after the beginning of 2017, but obviously, people would still enjoy listening to songs from previous years. The Spotiy API contains audio features data for every song in its library, so it would be worth collecting that data on every song for usage in the generation of song recommendations. Secondly, our data set excluded songs on Spotify, whose lyrics could not be found easily on Genius.com. We should have handled these cases by attempting to find the lyrics from other popular websites which store music lyrics. And lastly, we worked with a very small dataset relative to the total amount of songs that exist, or that are available on Spotify. There is great possibility in repeating this study quite easily with a greater selection of songs. We were surprised by how small the file sizes were of our dataset of 6551 songs, the aggregated data set being only 2.3 megabytes in size. Using that value, a set of one million songs can be estimated to only be around 350 megabytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare is utilizing Big Data to to assist in creating systems that can be used to detect health risks, implement preventative care, and provide an overall better experience for patients. However, there are fundmental issues that exist in the creation and implementation of these systems. Medical algorithms and efforts in precision medicine often neglect the structural inequalities that already exist for minorities accessing healthcare and therefore perpetuate bias in the healthcare industry. The author examines current applications of these concepts, how they are affecting minority communities in the United States, and discusses improvements in order to achieve more equitable care in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction&#34;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Data is helping to reshape healthcare through major advancements in telehealth and precision medicine. Due to the swift increase in telehealth services due to the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers at the University of California San Francisco have found that black and hispanic patients use these services less frequently than white patients. Prior to the pandemic, research showed that racial and ethnic minorities were disadvantaged by the digital divide &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These differences were attributed to disparities in access to technology and digital literacy &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Studies like these highlight how racial bias in healthcare is getting detected more frequently; However, there are few attempts to eradicate it through the use of similar technology. This has implications in various areas of healthcare including major healthcare algorithms, telehealth, precision medicine, and overall care provision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 1985 &lt;em&gt;Report of the Secretary’s Task Force on Black and Minority Health&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;lsquo;Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans and those of Asian/Pacific Islander heritage have not benefited fully or equitably from the fruits of science or from those systems responsible for translating and using health sciences technology&amp;rsquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The utilization of big data in industries largely acts to automate a process that was carried out by a human. This makes the process quicker to accomplish and the outcomes more precise since human error can now be eliminated. However, whenever people create the algorithms that are implemented, it is common that these algorithms will align with the biases of the human, or system, that created it. An area where this is happening that is especially alarming is the healthcare industry. Structural discrimination has long caused discrepencies in healthcare between white patients and minority patients and, with the introduction of big data to determine who should receive certain kinds of care, the issue has not been resolved but automated. Studies have shown that minority groups that are often at higher risk than white patients receive less preventative care while spending almost equal amounts on healthcare &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. National data also indicates that racial and ethnic minorities also have poorer health outcomes from preventable and treatable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, asthma, and HIV/AIDS than those in the majority &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-bias-in-medical-algorithms&#34;&gt;2. Bias in Medical Algorithms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a research article published to &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; in October of 2019, the researchers uncovered that one of the most used algorithms in healthcare, widely adopted by non- and for-profit medical centers and government agencies, less frequently identified black patients for preventative care than white patients. This algorithm is estimated to be applied to around 200 million people in the United States every year in order to target patients for high-risk care management. These programs seek to improve the care of patients with complex health needs by providing additional resources. The dataset used in the study contained the algorithms predictions, the underlying ingredients that formed the algorithm, and rich data outcomes which allowed for the ability to quantify racial disparities and isolate the mechanisms by which they arise. The sample consisted of 6,079 self-identified black patients and 43,539 self-identified white patients where 71.2% of all patients were enrolled in commercial insurance and 28.8% were on Medicare. On average, the patient age was 50.9 years old and 63% of patients were female. The patients enrolled in the study were classified among risk percentiles, where patients with scores at or above the 97th percentile were auto-enrolled and patients with scores over the 55th percentile were encouraged to enroll &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to measure health outcomes, they linked predictions to a wide range of outcomes in electronic health records, which included all diagnoses, and key quantitative laboratory studies and vital signs that captured the severity of chronic illnesses. When focusing on a point in the very-high-risk group, which would be patients in the 97th percentile, they were able to quantify the differences between white and black patients, where black patients had 26.3% more chronic illnesses than white patients&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. To get a corrected health outcome measurement among white and black patients, the researchers set a specific risk threshold for health outcomes among all patients, and repeated the procedure to replace healthier white patients with sicker black patients. So, for a white patient with a health risk score above the threshold, their data was replaced with a black patient whose score fell below the threshold and this continued until the health risk scores for black and white patients were equal and the predictive gap between patients would be eliminated. The health scores were based on the number of chronic medical conditions. The researchers then compared the data from their corrected algorithm and the original and found that the fraction of black patients at all risk thresholds above the 50th percentile increased when using the corrected algorithm. At the 97th percentile, the fraction of black patients increased to 46.5% from the original 17.7% &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Black patients are likely to have more severe hypertension, diabetes, renal failure, and anemia, and higher cholesterol. Using data from clinical trials and longitudinal studies, the researchers found that for mortality rates with hypertension and diabetes black patients had a 7.6% and 30% increase, respectively&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the original and corrected algorithms, black and white patients spent roughly the same amount on healthcare. However, black patients spent more on emergency care and dialysis while white patients spent more on inpatient surgery and outpatient specialist care&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In a study that tracked black patients with a black versus a white primary care provider, it found the occurrence of a black primary care provider recommending preventative care was significantly higher than recommendations from a white primary care provider. This conclusion sheds additional light on the disparities black patients face in the healthcare system and further adds to the lack of trust black people have in the healthcare system that has been heavily documented since the Tuskegee study &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The change recommended by the researchers that would correct the gap in the predictive care model was rather simple, shifting from predictions from purely future cost to an index that combined future cost prediction with health prediction. The researchers were able to work with the distributor of the original algorithm in order to make a more equitable algorithm. Since the original and corrected models from the study were both equal in cost but varied significantly in health predictions, they reworked the cost prediction based on health predictions, conditional on the risk factor percentiles. Both of the models excluded race from the predictions, but the algorithm created with the researchers saw an 84% reduction in bias among black patients, reducing the number of excess active chronic conditions in black patients to 7,758.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-disparities-found-with-data-dashboards&#34;&gt;3. Disparities Found with Data Dashboards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To relate this to a present health issue that is affecting everyone, more black patients are dying from the novel coronavirus than white patients. In the United States, in counties where more than 86% of residents are black, the COVID-19 death rates were 10 times higher than the national average &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Considering how medical algorithms allocate resources to black patients, similar trends are expected for minorities, people who speak languages other than english, low-income residents, and people without insurance. At Brigham Health, a member of the not-for-profit Mass General Brigham health system, Karthik Sivashanker, Tam Duong, Shauna Ford, Cheryl Clark, and Sunil Eappen created data dashboards in order to assist staff and those in positions of leadership. The dashboards included rates of those who tested positive for COVID-19 sorted into different subgroups based on race, ethnicity, language, sex, insurance status, geographic location, health-care worker status, inpatient and ICU census, deaths, and discharges &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the use of these dashboards, the COVID-19 equity committee were able to identify emerging risks to incident command leaders, including the discovery that non-English speaking Hispanic patients had higher mortality rates when compared to English speaking Hispanic patients. This led to quality-improvement efforts to increase patient access to language interpreters. While attempting to implement these changes, it was discovered that efforts to reduce clinicians entering patient rooms to maintain social distancing guidelines was impacting the ability for interpreters to join at a patient&amp;rsquo;s bedside during clinician rounding. The incident command leadership expanded their virtual translation services by purchasing additional iPads to allow interpreters and patients to communicate through online software. The use of the geographic filter, when combined with a visual map of infection-rates by neighborhood, showed that people who lived in historically segregated and red-lined neighborhoods were tested less frequently but tested positive more frequently than those from affluent white neighborhoods &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In a study conducted with survey data from the Pew Research Center on U.S. adults with internet access, black people were significantly more likely to report using telehealth services. In the same study, black and latino respondents had higher odds of using telehealth to report symptoms &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, COVID-19 is not the only disease that
researchers have found to be higher in historically segregated communities. In 1999, Laumann and Youm found that disparities segregation in social and sexual networks explained racial disparities in STDs which, they suggested, could also explain the disparities black people face in the spread of other diseases &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Prior to 1999 researchers believed that some unexplained characteristic of black people described the spread of such diseases, which shows the pervasiveness of racism in healthcare and academia. Residential segregation may influence health by concentrating poverty, environmental pollutants, infectious agents, and other adverse conditions. In 2006, Morello-Frosch and Jesdale found that segregation increased the risk of cancer related to air pollution &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Big Data can assess national and local public health for disease prevention. An example is how the National Health Interview Survey is being used to estimate insurance coverage in different areas of the U.S. population and clinical data is being used to measure access and quality-related outcomes. Community-level data can be linked with health care system data using visualization and network analysis techniques which would enable public health officials and clinicians to effectively allocate resources and assess whether all patients are getting the medical services they need &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This would drastically improve the health of historically segregated and red-lined communities who are already seeing disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-effect-of-precision-medicine-and-predictive-care&#34;&gt;4. Effect of Precision Medicine and Predictive Care&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health experts established that the most important determinant of health throughout a person’s course of life is the environment where they live, learn, work, and play. There exists a discrepancy between electronic health record systems in well-resourced clinical practices and smaller clinical sites, leading to disparities in how they are able to support population health management. For Big Data technology, if patient, family, and community focus were implemented equally in both settings, it has shown that the social determinants of health information would both improve public health among minority communities and minimize the disparities that would arise. Geographic information systems are one way to locate social determinants of health. These help focus public health interventions on populations at greater risk of health disparities. Duke University used this type of system to visualize the distribution of individuals with diabetes across Durham County, NC in order to explore the gaps in access to care and self-management resources. This allowed them to identify areas of need and understand where to direct resources. A novel approach to identify place-based disparities in chronic diseases was used by Young, Rivers, and Lewis where they analyzed over 500 million tweets and found a significant association between the geographic location of HIV-related tweets and HIV prevalence, a disease which is known to predominantly affect the black community &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways researchers call for strengthening the health of the nation is through community-level engagement. This is often ignored when it comes to precision medicine, which is one of the latest ways that big data is influencing healthcare. It has the potential to benefit racial and ethnic minority populations since there is a lack of clinical trial data with adequate numbers of minority populations. It is because of this lack of clinical data that predictions in precision medicine are often made off risks associated with the majority which give preferential treatment to those in the majority while ignoring the risks of minority groups, further widening the gap in the allocation of preventative health resources. These predictive algorithms are rooted in cost/benefit tradeoffs, which were proven to limit resources to black patients from the science magazine article on medical algorithms &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For the 13th Annual Texas Conference on Health Disparities, the overall theme was &amp;ldquo;Diversity in the Era of Precision Medicine.&amp;rdquo; Researchers at the event said diversity should be kept at the forefront when designing and implementing the study in order to increase participation by minority groups &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Building a trusting relationship with the community is also necessary for increased participation, therefore the institution responsible for recruitment needs to be perceived as trustworthy by the community. Some barriers for participation shared among minority groups are hidden cost of participation, concern about misuse of research data, lack of understanding the consent form and research materials, language barrier, low perceived risk of disease, and fear of discrimination &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. As discussed previously, overall lack of distrust in the research process is rooted in the fact that research involving minority groups often overwhelmingly benefits the majority by comparison. Due to the lack of representation of minority communities, big clinical data can be generated for the means of conducting pragmatic trials with underserved populations and distribute the lack of benefits &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;41-precision-public-health&#34;&gt;4.1 Precision Public Health&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit of the majority highlights the issue that one prevention strategy does not account for everyone. This is the motivation behind combining precision medicine and public health to create precision public health. The goal of this is to target populations that would benefit most from an intervention as well as identify which populations the intervention would not be suitable for. Machine learning applied to clinical data has been used to predict acute care use and cost of treatment for asthmatic patients and diagnose diabetes, both of which are known to affect black people at greater rates than white patients &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This takes into account the aforementioned factors that contribute to a person’s health and combines it with genomic data. Useful information about diseases at the population level are attributed to advancements in genetic epidemiology, through increased genetic and genomic testing. Integration of genomic technologies with public health initiatives have already shown success in preventing diabetes and cancers for certain groups, both of which affect black patients at greater rates than white patients. Specifically, black men have the highest incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer. The presence of Kaiso, a transcriptional repressors present in human genes, is abundant in those with prostate cancer and, in black populations, it has been shown to increase cancer aggressive and reduce survival rates &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The greatest challenge affecting advancements made to precision public health is the involvement of all subpopulations required to get effective results. This demonstrates another area where there’s a need for the healthcare industry to prioritize building a stronger relationship with minority communities in order to assist in advancing healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a stronger relationship with patients begins with having an understanding of the patient’s needs and their backgrounds, requiring multicultural understanding on the physicians side. This can be facilitated by the technological advances in healthcare. Researchers from Johns Hopkins University lay out three strategic approaches to improve multicultural communications. The first is providing direct services to minimize the gap in language barriers through the use of interpreters and increased linguistic competency in health education materials. The second is the incorporation of cultural homophily in care through staff who share a cultural background, inclusion of holistic medical suggestions, and the use of community health workers. Lastly, they highlight the need for more institutional accommodation such as increasing the ability of professionals to interact effectively within the culture of the patient population, more flexible hours of operation, and clinic locations &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These strategic approaches are much easier to incorporate into practice when used in telehealth monitoring, providing more equitable care to minority patients who are able to use these services. There are three main sections of telehealth monitoring which include synchronous, asynchronous, and remote monitoring. Synchronous would be any real-time interaction, whether it be over the telephone or through audio/visual communication via a tablet or smartphone. This could occur when the patient is at their home or they are present with a healthcare professional while consulting with a medical provider virtually. Asynchronous communication occurs when patients communicate with their provider through a secure messaging platform in their patient portal. Remote patient monitoring is the direct transmission of a patient’s clinical measurements to their healthcare provider. Remote access to healthcare would be the most beneficial to those who are medically and socially vulnerable or those without ready access to providers and could also help preserve the patient-provider relationship &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Connecting a patient to a provider that is from a similar cultural or ethnic background becomes easier through a virtual consultation, a form of synchronous telehealth monitoring. A virtual consultation would also help eliminate the need for transportation and open up the flexibility of meeting times for both the patient and the provider. From this, a way to increase minority patient satisfaction in regards to healthcare during the shift to telehealth services due to COVID-19 restrictions would be a push to increase technology access to these groups by providing them with low-cost technology with remote-monitoring capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-telehealth-and-telemedicine-applications&#34;&gt;5. Telehealth and Telemedicine Applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telehealth monitoring is evolving the patient-provider relationship by extending care beyond the in-person clinical visit. This provides an excellent opportunity to build a more trusting and personal relationship with the patient, which would be critical for minority patients as it would likely increase their trust in the healthcare system. Also, with an increase in transparency and involvement with their healthcare, the patient will be more engaged in the management of their healthcare which will likely have more satisfactory outcomes. Implementing these types of services will create large amounts of new data for patients, requiring big data applications in order to manage it. Similar to the issue of inequality in the common medical algorithm for determination of preventative care, if the data collected from minority groups using this method is not accounted for properly, then the issue of structural discrimination will continue. The data used in healthcare decision-making often comes from a patient’s electronic health record.  An issue that presents itself when considering the use of a patient’s electronic health record in the process of using big data to assist with the patient’s healthcare is missing data. In the scope of telehealth monitoring, since the visit and most of the patient monitoring would be done virtually, the electronic health record would need to be updated virtually as well &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For telehealth to be viable, the tools that accommodate it need to work seamlessly and be supported by the data streams that are integrated into the electronic health record. Most electronic health record systems are unable to be populated with remote self-monitoring patient-generated data &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, the American Telemedicine Association is advocating for remotely-monitored patient-generated data to be incorporated into electronic health records. The SMART Health IT platform is an approach that would allow clinical apps to run across health systems and integrate with electronic health records through the use of a standards-based open-source application programming interface (API) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). There are also advancements being made in technology that is capable of integrating data from electronic health records with claims, laboratory, imaging, and pharmacy data &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. There is also a push to include social determinants of health disparities including genomics and socioeconomic status in order to further research underlying causes of health disparities &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;51-limitations-of-teleheath-and-telemedicine&#34;&gt;5.1 Limitations of Teleheath and Telemedicine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of lack of access to the internet and devices that would be necessary for virtual health visits would limit the participation of those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. From this arises the issue of representativeness in remotely-monitored studies where the participant must have access to a smartphone or tablet. However, much like the Brigham Health group providing iPads in order to assist with language interpretation, there should be an incentive to provide access to these devices for patients in high risk groups in order to boost trust and representation in this type of care. From the article that discussed the survey results that found black and latino patients to be more responsive to using telehealth, the researchers contrasted the findings with another study where 52,000 Mount Sinai patients were monitored between March and May of 2020 that found black patients were less likely to use telehealth than white patients &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. One reason for the discrepancy the researchers introduce is that the Pew survey, while including data from across the country, only focused on adults that had internet access. This brings up the need for expanding broadband access, which is backed by many telehealth experts &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of providing internet access and devices with internet capabilities to those without them should be similar to that from the science magazine study where patients whose risk scores are above a certain threshold should automatically qualify for technological assistance. Programs such as the Telehealth Network Grant Program would be beneficial for researchers conducting studies with a similar focus, as the grant emphasizes advancements in tele-behavioral health and tele-emergency medical services and providing access to these services to those who live in rural areas. Patients from rural areas are less likely to have access to technology that would enable them to participate in a study requiring remote monitoring. The grant proposal defines tele-emergency as an electronic, two-way, audio/visual communication service between a central emergency healthcare center, the tele-emergency hub, and a remote hospital emergency department designed to provide real-time emergency care consultation &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is especially important when considering that major medical algorithms show that black patients often spend more on emergency medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-conclusion&#34;&gt;6. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Data is changing many areas of healthcare and all of the areas that it’s affecting can benefit from making structural changes in order to allow minorities to get equitable healthcare. This includes how the applications are put into place, since Big Data has the ability to demonstrate bias and reinforce structural discrimination in care. It should be commonplace to consider race or ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and other relevant social determinants of health in order to account for this. Several studies have displayed the need for different allocations of resources based on race and ethnicity. From the findings that black patients were often given more equitable treatment when matched with a primary care provider that was black and that COVID-19 has limited in-person resources, such as a bedside interpreter for non-English speaking patients, there should be a development of a resource that allows people to be matched with a primary care provider that aligns with their identity and to connect with them virtually. When considering the lack of trust black people and other minority populations have in the healthcare system, there are a variety of services that would help boost trust in the process of getting proper care. Given the circumstances surrounding COVID-19 pandemic, there is already an emphasis on making improvements within telehealth monitoring as barriers to telehealth have been significantly reduced. Several machine-learning based studies have highlighted the importance of geographic location’s impact on aspects of the social determinants of health, including the effects in segregated communities. Recent work has shown that black and other ethnic minority patients report having less involvement in medical decisions and lower levels of satisfaction of care. This should motivate researchers who are focused on improving big data applications in the healthcare sector to focus on these communities in order to eliminate disparities in care and increase the amount of minority healthcare workers in order to have accurate representation. From the survey data showing that minority populations were more likely to use telehealth services, there needs to be an effort to highlight these communities in future work surrounding telehealth and telemedicine. Several studies have prepared a foundation for what needs to be improved and have already paved the way for additional research. With the progress that these studies have made and continued reports of inadequacies in care, it is only a matter of time before substantial change is implemented and equitable care is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big data in sports is being used more and more as technology advances and this has a very big impact, especially when it comes to sports gambling. Sports gambling has been around for a while and it is gaining popularity with it being legalized in more places across the world. It is a very lucrative industry and the bookmakers use everything they can to make sure the overall odds are in their favor so they can reduce the risk of paying out to the betters and ensure a steady return. Sports statistics and data is more important than ever for bookmakers to come up with the odds they put out to the public. Odds are no longer just determined by expert analyzers for a specific sport. The compilation of odds uses a lot of historical data about team and player performance and looks at the most intricate details in order to ensure accuracy. Bookmakers spend a lot of money to employ the best statisticians and the best algorithms. There are also many companies that solely focus on sports data analysis, who often work with bookmakers around the world. On the other hand, big data for sports game analysis is also used by gamblers to gain a competitive edge. Many different algorithms have been created by researchers and gamblers to try to beat the bookmakers, some more successful than others. Oftentimes these not only involve examining sports data, but also analysing data from different bookmakers odds in order to determine the best bets to place. Overall, big data is very important in this field and this research paper aims to show the various techniques that are used by different stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction&#34;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Data in sports has been used for years by various stakeholders in this industry to do everything from predicting game outcomes to injury prevention. It is also becoming very prevalent in the area of sports gambling. Ever since the Supreme court decision in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association that overturned a ban on sports betting, the majority of states in the US have passed legislation to allow sports gambling &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In 2019, the global sports betting market was valued at 85.047 US Dollars so this is an already very big industry that is expanding &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. There are various platforms that allow betting in this industry including tangible sports books, casinos, racetracks, and many online and mobile gambling apps. The interesting thing about big data in sports betting is that it is being used on both sides in this market. It is used by bookmakers to create game models and come up with different spreads and odds, but big data analysis is also being used by gamblers to gain a competetive advantage and place more accurate bets. Various prediction models using machine learning and big data analytics have been created and they can sometimes be very accurate. For example, Google correctly predicted 14 out of the 16 matches in the 2014 world cup and Microsoft did even better by correctly predicting 15 out of the 16 matches during that year &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Many big companies have spent a lot of time gathering lots of data and creating prediction algorithms, inlcuding ESPN&amp;rsquo;s Football Power index that gives the probility of one team beating another, Analytics Powerhouse 538 that determines scores of games using their ELO method, and Accuscore which runs Mone Carlo Simulations on worldwide sporting events &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Bookmakers use all their possible tools and algorithms to put out the best odds that will give them a return. They often employ teams of statisticians that use the most advanced prediction models and information from data analysis companies to come up with their odds. If sports data analysis is vastly being used by people other than bookies and prediction models can often be very accurate, one might wonder how people haven&amp;rsquo;t made millions off sports betting and how bookmakers are still in business? This report analyzes how big data analytics are used by bookmakers to come up with the odds they put out for games while also examining how it is used on the gamblers side. It aims to analysize various prediction models created by sports betters, researchers, and AI companies, and see how they compare to the way big data is used by bookmakers. Besides giving an analysis of how big data is used in this field, it will show if betting guided by prediction models can give a consistent return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-background&#34;&gt;2. Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people with an interest in sports betting prediction have created models, some that involve machine learning and AI. A few of these projects have had some very interesting results using different types of data and analysis techniques. Jordan Bailey created an NBA prediction model based on the over under bets &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For context, bookmakers will set a point total for a game and bettors can bet on whether the actual score will be over or under the point total set by the book. This type of betting is offered for many types of sports. Using NBA box scores for 5 previous seasons and data on historical betting lines created by various bookmakers, Bailey created a logistical regression model that would return a prediction on if the score was over or under a point total set by a bookmaker. Two models were created, one that predicted if a game would be over a set line and one that predicted if it would be under a set line. The datasets for these models were structured in a way where each specific game was represented as the box scores for the 3 previous games for each team, so 6 previous games &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. When creating the model, the first four seasons were used as the training set and the fifth season was used as the testing data to make predictions on &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In order to determine the significance of results, Bailey set up a &amp;ldquo;confidence threshold&amp;rdquo; of 62 percent for the probability his model returned on a game being over or under. The prediction was &amp;ldquo;confident&amp;rdquo; if the probability of the prediction was above the set threshold. When testing the models, the over model predicted 88 games confidently and 52 games correctly, with an accuracy of 59.09 percent. The under model predicted 96 games confidently and correctly predicted 52 games with an accuracy of 54.16 percent &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. To simulate how the model would perform on betting with 10,000 dollars, a bet was made every time the model predicted a confident bet for the 2018 NBA season. The accuracy on the bets were 52.52 percent and the total after the simulation was 11,880 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-how-bookmakes-determine-odds&#34;&gt;3. How bookmakes Determine odds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no secret that bookmakers use a lot of data and apply various statistical techniques to come up with betting odds. The statistical techniques used and the data that bookmakers look at vary from sport to sport, for example, a popular method for modeling soccer uses the Poisson distribution since it can be very accurate but also because it makes it easy to add time decay to the inputs &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Big data and data accuracy plays such a big part for bookmakers that many companies in the sports betting market have multi million dollar contracts with big leagues like the NFL &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The NBA also recently extended their contracts with Sportradar and Genius Sports group that will have the rights to distribute official NBA data to licenced sports betting operators in the United States &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Companies like Sportradar collect and analyze official data and provide services to various bookmakers. The accuracy of data can be very important, a difference of something as little as one yard can make such a big difference; therefore, the industry values the accuracy of data that the leagues itself can provide. Bookmakers employ various mathematicians to analyze historical sports data to come up with odds; however, sports data isn’t the only thing that bookmakers look at when determining how they will make odds for a game. At the end of the day, the gambling industry is a numbers game that thrives on ensuring the probability is in the houses favor. Bookmakers use various techniques involving big data and factors such as public opinion to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big data is being used more and more in various industries, and in the gambling industry, it isn&amp;rsquo;t just used to come up with odds. One major way it is used is by gathering data about user demographics &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. When using an online sportsbook, the casino can gather data about a users age, location, gender, excetera which can provide valuable insights that can be used for product development and marketing purposes. By using user demographic data to provide targeted advertising, casinos and bookmakers can attract more betters which will increase revenue. As said by former odds compiler Matthew Trenhaile, &amp;ldquo;Their [bookmakers] product is entertainment and not the selling of an intellectual contest between punter and bookmaker. It is foolish to think this has ever been the product that bookmakers have sold.They sell an adrenaline rush and anyone who thinks great characters pitting themselves against the punters and taking anyone on in horse racing betting rings is what betting used to be about is kidding himself or herself.&amp;rdquo; Due to the probability of making money in sports betting, and really every type of gambling, being in the houses favor, online casinos and sportsbooks use big data to increase the number of bets placed by customers; nevertheless, using models to come up with odds is the heart of this industry which makes it the most important way big data analytics is used by bookmakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When odds are being made for a sports book, a lot of things are taken into consideration in the process. Bookmakers have teams of statisticians that analyze historical data of the teams in order to come up with game prediction models, often using machine learning based algorithms&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. When bookmakers are actually making the odds, these statistical models created from large amounts of data aren&amp;rsquo;t the only thing they use. When bookmakers are creating odds, their goal isn&amp;rsquo;t to come up with an accurate game prediction, it is to have the lowest probability of paying out, so they will add a margin in order to statistically ensure a profit regardless of the outcome. Some times public opinion is used by bookmakers to sway their odds. For example, if a team has been on an unexpected winning streak, the bookmakers will often overestimate their odds, even against a team that will statistically do better than them, since people will be more inclined to take that bet resulting in the bookmaker reducing their probability of paying out &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, bookmakers will often &amp;ldquo;hedge&amp;rdquo; bets to cover potential losses if an unexpected outcome occurs. For example, if a large amount of people are betting on a team regardless of the odds, the bookmakers will have a large payout if that outcome occurs, so they will start offering more favorable odds on the opposite outcome so they can bring in bets that would cover their losses &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. At the end of the day, when bookmakers set out their odds they will always make sure they are statistically in their favor. Even though bookmakers heavily analyze sports data in order to come up with prediction models, the odds put out don&amp;rsquo;t exactly reflect the true probability of a game outcome. Game prediction models is used to come up with the most probable event occurring but bookmakers add a margin that is skews the actual probability in order to statistically ensure a profit &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. An example of a coin toss can show how these margins work &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. If one were to bet on a coin toss, there is a 50 percent change of heads winning and a 50 percent change of tails winning so that means neither side is favored and the market of this bet is 100 percent. As a bookmaker is trying to ensure a profit, they will add a margin to the actual game winning probability in order to mitigate risk and ensure that the odds are in their favor. The margins that the bookmakers put on the actual probability is determined by many factors such as public opinion and perception of a team &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Gamblers are actually able to calculate the margins that the bookmakers put on a bet using a relatively simple formula. This formula varies for the type of sports the gambler is trying to calculate the odds for. In a two way market such as tennis or basketball, a person can figure out the bookmakers margin using the decimal odds places for both sides &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This formula is 100(1/decimal odds) + 1000(1/other decimal odds). The amount the market percentage is over 100 is the margin the bookmaker has on the better; therefore, the margin percentage the bookmaker has over the gambler can be determined by subtracting 100 from that formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-poisson-model&#34;&gt;5. Poisson Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular models for soccer game predictions is the Poisson distribution model. According to former odds compiler Matthew Trenhaile, the Poisson distribution model for soccer prediction can be very accurate and is very useful since it is easy to add time decay to the inputs &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Refinements can easily be made as a game progresses and goal input changes to easily re calculate the odds, which is useful for bookmakers. The Poisson distribution for soccer game predictions is not only used on a large scale by bookmakers to calculate odds, but it is also often used by even small time bettors to determine how they will bet. A Poisson model for soccer games can even be created on Excel for betters who want to place their bets more accurately. This process works by using historical data of how many goals a team scored and how many goals they let in and comparing it to a leagues average in order to determine the number of goals each team is likely to score in a game. It starts with calculating the average number of goals scored for home games and away games for the whole league and determining a team&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;attack strength&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;defense strength&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The attack strength is a team&amp;rsquo;s average number of goals per game divided by the league average of goals per game. Similarly, a teams defense strength is determined by dividing a teams average number of goals conceded by the leagues average number of goals conceded. The goal expectancy for the home team is calculated by multiplying the team&amp;rsquo;s attack strength with the away team&amp;rsquo;s defense strength and the league&amp;rsquo;s average number of home goals. The goal expectancy for the away team is calculated by multiplying the away teams attack strength with the home teams defense strength and multiplying it by the leagues average number of away goals &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. With this information, one can determine the probability for the range of goal outcomes on both sides using a formula created by the French mathematician Simeon Denis Poisson. The Poisson distribution indicates the probability of a given number of events occurring over a fixed interval, so it can be used to determine the probability of the number of goals scored in a soccer game. The formula for this for soccer prediction is P(x events in interval) = (e-μ) (μx) / x! . This formula determines the probability of the number of goals being scored (x) using Euler’s number (e) and the goal expectancy (μ). With this formula, we can see the probability each team has for scoring a number of goals in a game. Usually the distribution is done for 0-5 goals to see the percentages of each team scoring on the goal interval. This can be used by bookmakers to determine odds and by gamblers to make well educated bets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-algorithms-and-prediction-models&#34;&gt;6. Algorithms and prediction models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamblers often use various models, driven by big data, in order to help them place more accurate bets. Many different models have been created in the sports field that use factors such as historical sports data in order to come up with game prediction models. A lot of people who have come up with good prediction models will not share how they work and sometimes offer a subscription service where eager gamblers can pay to receive game picks.  When it comes to making the best sports betting algorithms, it isn&amp;rsquo;t just about the amount of data a person can acquire. Creating algorithms that predict well takes understanding the sport and the meaning behind each type of data. In regards to creating sports prediction algorithms and the data that goes behind it, Micheal Beuoy, an actuary and popular sports data analyst said, &amp;ldquo;I think it takes discipline combined with a solid understanding of the sport you’re trying to analyze. If you don’t understand the context behind your numbers, no amount of advanced analysis and complicated algorithms is going to help you make sense of them. You need discipline because it is very easy to lock in on a particular theory and only pay attention to the data points that confirm that theory. A good practice is to always set aside a portion of your data before you start analysing. Once you’ve built what you think is your &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; model or theory, you can then test it against this alternative dataset.&amp;rdquo; Creating sports prediction algorithms requires a lot of different types of analysis and the methods that yield the best results are always changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating good models requires understanding the sport well and using specific types of data in the algorithms. A creator of an NBA game prediction algorithm who runs a website called Fast Break Bets, which sells a game prediction service, primarily uses NBA game statistics known as efficiency metrics to come up with his model &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. As the creator of the algorithm is profiting off eager gamblers, the exacts of how it works have not been released but the creator explains the type of data he uses to make his algorithm work. The NBA is a game of efficiency since there is a shot clock and possessions are changed very quickly, so the score total of games can greatly vary by how fast or slow paced a team is. The creator of this algorithm uses an offensive and defensive rating that measures how many points a team scores and allows per 100 possessions, since 100 possessions is close to the NBA average of possessions per game &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The algorithm also uses effective field goal percentage, turnover rate, and rebounding rate with offensive and defensive rating to optimize the efficiency metrics. Another major factor that this creator uses in the algorithm is the NBA season schedule and how often a team plays  games in a time span &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is due to the fact that players get fatigued playing games close to each other and coaches will therefore limit the amount of time some of the players will be on the court in order to give them a rest. This is important since player statistics can greatly vary from person to person on a team. Using this information of efficiency metrics, player performance,  and the frequency of games played, the creator was able to create a prediction model that works well enough for people to pay for his game picks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In research done by Manuel Silvero, he studied 5 famous algorithms that used Neural Network and Machine learning and concluded that their accuracy varies from 50-70 percent, depending on the sport &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Purucker in 1996 was one of the first computational sports prediction model and used an Artificial Neural Network with backward propagation &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was 61 percent accurate. In 2003, Khan expanded Puruckers work and was more acurate. Data on 208 matches was collected and the elements used were total yardage differential, rushing yardage differential, turnover differential, away team indicator and home team indicator &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The first 192 matches of the season were used as the training data set for the model. When tested on the remaining games of the season, the models predicted at a 75 percent accuracy. This was compared to predictions created by 8 ESPN sportscasters for the same games and they only predicted 63 percent of those matches correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most accurate models created, in terms of receiving  a good return on a bet, was created by Lisandro Kaunitz of the University of Tokyo, and relied on data from odds that bookmakers put out rather than historical game data &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. When it comes to statistical models for sports, big data from historical sports games are often analyzed in order to come up with game predictions and to gain insight on things like team, player, and position performance. In the market of sports betting, these models are used to come up with odds and also by bettors to place bets. Gamblers have came up with different game prediction models in order to beat the books, mainly comprising of historical sports data while sometimes also using historical betting data &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Kaunitz created a model that mainly focused on analysing data of the odds created by bookmakers, rather than sports team data, to predict good bets to place. The basis of his model relied on a technique bookmakers use to reduce their payout risk, known as hedging. This concept and the way bookmakers use it to reduce their risk of payout is covered in section 3. Kaunitz betting model worked by gathering the odds for a game created by various bookmakers and determining the average odds available. Using statistical analysis of odds offered, Kaunitz was able to determine any outliers from the average odds for a game &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Using these outliers, Kaunitz could determine if a bet would favor them or not. After various simulations and models, Kaunitz&amp;rsquo;s and his team took their strategy into the real world, and their bets payed out 47.2 percent of the time. They received an 8.5 percent return and profited $957.50 in 265 bets &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Due to their impressive returns, bookmakers caught on and started to limit the amount that they could bet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;7-conclusion&#34;&gt;7. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, big data plays a very important role in the sports betting industry and it is used by various stakeholders. Bookmakers use it to come up with odds and gamblers use it for a competitive advantage. Although data analysis is very important on both ends, this research shows that it is very hard to receive a consistent return as a gambler. From 1989 to 2000 for NFl betting, the bookmakers favorite won 66.7 percent of the time and from 2001 and 2012, the bookmakers favorite won 66.9 percent of the time &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  Even though technology has advanced and people use the most sophisticated algorithms to come up with prediction models, the bookmaker seems to have the advantage. This is due to the fact that bookmakers spend tons of money gathering the most accurate data and employ some of the best statisticians and sports analysing firms, but also due to the way they hedge bets and use public opinion to modify odds in order prevent potential losses. Bookmakers adjust for a margin when they are compiling their odds, because just like everything in the gambling industry, the probability is set up so that the house will always win in the long run. Gamblers have created various algorithms in order to make the most educated sports bet. These use historical team data but sometimes also use data from betting odds. Some of the best betting algorithms work by analyzing bookmakers&#39; odds and determining where the odds are significantly different from the expected outcome of the game. As seen with Lisandro Kaunitz from the University of Tokyo, when bookmakers see that gamblers are beating the system they can start to limit a person&amp;rsquo;s bets. Overall, big data plays a huge role in the sports gambling industry. Even though what happens on the field or the court is often based on chance, there are significant trends that can be seen when statistically analyzing sports data. At the end of the day, big data plays a big role in this industry for bookmakers and gamblers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords:&lt;/strong&gt; Text-to-Speech Synthesis, Speech Synthesis, Artificial Voice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction&#34;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of making machines talk has be around for many over 200 years. For example, in as early as 1779, a scientist called Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein built models of the human vocal tract (the cavity in human beings where voice is produced in) that can produce the sound of long vowels (a, e, i , o, u)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. From then till the 1950s, there have been many successful studies and attempts to make physical models that mechanically imitate the human voice. In the late 1960s, the people trying to synthesize human voice started to do it electronically. In 1961, by utilizing the IBM 704 (one of the first mass produced computers), John Larry Kelly Jr and Louis Gerstman, made a voice recorder synthesizer (aka. vocoder). Their system was able to recreate the song &amp;quot;Daisy Bell&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Before the current deep neural network trend, modern systems for text-to-Speech (TTS) or speech synthesis has been dominated by concatenative methods and then statistical parametric methods. Creating the ability for humans to converse with computers or any machines is a one of those age-old dreams of humans. A human-computer interaction technology that provides the computers to comprehend raw human speech has been revolutionized in last couple of years by the amount of big data we have now and the implementation, mainly deep neural networks, that feeds on big data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-350/main/report/images/TTScomponents.png&#34; alt=&#34;Figure1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Illustration of a typical TTS system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-overview-of-the-technology&#34;&gt;2. Overview of the Technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concatenative methods work by stringing together segments of prerecorded speech segments. The best of concatenative methods is the Unit Selection. The recorded voice segments in unit selection is categorized into individual phones, diphones, half-phones, morphemes, syllable, words, and phrases. Unit selection divides a sentence into segmented units by a speech recognizer, then these units are filled in with recorded voice segments based on parameters like frequency, duration, syllable position, as well as these parameters of its neighboring units &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The output of this system can be undistinguishable from natural voice, but only in very specific context that it is being tuned for and provided that the system has a very large database of speeches, usually in the range of dozens of hours of speech. This system suffers from boundary artifacts, which are unnatural connections between the sewed-together speech segments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What came after concatenative methods are the statistical parametric methods, it solved many of the concatenative method&amp;rsquo;s boundary artifact problems. Statistical Parametric methods are also called Hidden-Markov-Models-based (HHM-based) methods, because HMM are often the choice to model the probability distribution of speech parameters. The HH model selects the most likely speech parameters like frequency spectrum, fundamental frequency, and duration (prosody), given the word sequence and trained model parameters. Last, these speech parameters are combined to construct a final speech wave form. Statistical parametric synthesis can be described as /&amp;ldquo;generating the average of some sets of similarly sounding speech segment&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The advantage that statistical parametric methods have over concatenative methods is the ability to modify aspects of the speech such as the gender of speaker, or the emotion and emphasis of the speech. The use of statistical parametric methods marks the beginning of the transition from a knowledge-based system to a data-based system for speech synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a high-level point of view, a text-to-speech system is composed of two components. The first component starts with text normalization, also called preprocessing or tokenization. Text normalization converts symbols, numbers, and abbreviations into normal dictionary words. After text normalization, the first components end with text-to-phenome. Text-to-phenome is the process of dividing the text into units like words, phrases, and sentences; then converting these units into target phonetic representations, or target prosody (frequency contour, durations, etc.) The second component, often called the synthesizer or vocoder, takes the symbolic phonetic representations and converts them into the final sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-350/main/report/images/prosody.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Figure2&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Illustration of prosody&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-main-example-tacotron-1--2-and-wavenet-for-voice-synthesis&#34;&gt;3. Main Example: Tacotron 1 &amp;amp; 2 and WaveNet for Voice Synthesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tacotron a TTS system that begin by using a sequence to sequence architecture implemented with neural network to produce magnitude spectrograms with a given string of text. The first component of Tacotron is one single neural network that was trained from 24.6 hours of speech audio recorded by a professional female speaker. The effectiveness of a neural network in speech synthesis shows how big data approaches are improving and changing up the speech synthesis methodologies. Tacotron uses the Giffin-Lim algorithm for its second component, the vocoder. The authors note that their choice of approach for the second component is only used as a placeholder at that time, and they anticipated that the Tacotron is be more advanced with alternative approaches for the second component, the vocoder, in the future &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And Tacotron 2 is what the authors of the original Tacotron might have envisioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tacotron 2 is a TTS system built entirely using neural network architectures for both its first and second component. Tacotron 2 combines the original tacotron’s first component and combine it with Google’s WaveNet that serves as the second component. The tacotron-style first component responsible for preprocessing and text-to-phenome, produces mel spectrograms given the original text input. Mel spectrograms are representations of frequencies in mel scale as it varies over different time. The mel spectrograms are then fed into WaveNet, a vocoder that serves as the second component, which outputs the final sound &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WaveNet is a deep neural network model that can generate raw audio.  What is different about WaveNet is that it can model and generate the raw audio form. Typically, audio is digitized by sampling a single data point for every very small-time interval. A raw audio wave form typically contains 16,000 sample point in every second of audio. With that many sample points per second, an audio clip of a simple speech would contain millions and billions of data points. To make a generative model for these sample audio points, the model needs to be autoregressive, meaning every sample point generated by the model is influenced by its earlier sample points that is also generated by the model itself &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A very difficult challenge that DeepMind solved. Before DeepMind came up with WaveNet, they made pixelRNN and pixel CNN. Which proved that it is possible to generate a complicated image one pixel at a time given a large amount of quality training data. This time instead of an image generated a pixel at a time, an audio clip is generated one sample point at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WaveNet is trained with audio recordings, or wave forms, from real human speech. After training the model, WaveNet can generate synthetic utterances of human speech that does not actually mean anything. WaveNet would be fed a random audio sample point, and it will predict the next audio sample point and feed it back to itself and generating the next one, so on and so forth, producing complex realistic speech wave form. To apply WaveNet to TTS systems, it would have to be trained not only the human speech but also each training sample’s corresponding linguistic and phonetic features. This way, WaveNet would be conditioned on both the previous audio sample points and the words we want WaveNet to say. In a real working TTS system, these linguistic and phonetic features are the product of the first component, which is responsible for text-to-phenome &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;31-application-and-implications-of-a-lifelike-tts-system-like-tacotron-2&#34;&gt;3.1 Application and Implications of a lifelike TTS system like Tacotron 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The powerful and lifelike TTS system by Tacotron 2 and Wavenet enhances many real-life applications that relies on having a machine talk, but most predominantly in human-computer interaction like smart phone voice assistant. And naturally, with a TTS system so lifelike, there are some concerns it would be used for nefarious purposes; but it also enables great enhancements to current applications of TTS systems. In one example researchers are able to build system that adds a speech encoder system on top of Tacotron 2 and Wavenet, and make it so it would be able to clone anyone’s voice signature and produce any speech wave forms with that person’s voice with just a few seconds of his or her original speech recording &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The objective of the speaker encoder network added on to Tacotron 2 and Wavenet is to learn a high quality representation of a target speaker’s voice. In other words, the speaker encoder network is made to learn the &amp;ldquo;essence&amp;rdquo; and intricacies of human voices. The theory is that with this speech embeddings (representations) of a particular voice signature, Tacotron 2 and Wavenet would be able to use that to generate brand new speeches with the same voice signature. The most importance reason why this system is able to work with and extrapolate from an unseen and small amount of audio recording of the target speaker is a large and diverse amount of data of different speakers used to train the speaker encoder network &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This demonstrates that not only big data contributed to the success of this network but that the big data also has to be the right data, with &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; being having a diverse amount of different variations in speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible benefit of such a system can provide is in speech to speech translation across different languages. Because the system only requires couple seconds of un-transcribed reference audio recorded from the target speaker, this system can be used to enhance current, top of the line, speech to speech translation system like Google Translate by generating the output speech that is in another language with the original speaker’s voice. This makes the generated speech more natural and realistic sounding for the intended listener of the translated speech in a real world setting &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. An example of a fun implementation of such a system is the option to choose celebrity’s voices, like John Legend’s voice, as the voice of your Google Assistant in your smart phone or your Google Home &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But a different and potentially dangerous implication of a system being misused and abused is not hard to imagine as well, especially that sometimes the artificially synthesized speech by these latest TTS systems are rated as indistinguishable from real human speech &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. According to a study, our brain does not register significant differences between a morphed voice and a real voice &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, while we can still somewhat distinguish between a genuine and artificial voice, we probably will be fooled most of the time if we are not particularly paying attention and on the look out for it. For example, people can be fooled into believing or doing certain things, because the voice that they talked too belongs to someone who that trust or someone who they believe holds a certain type of authority. While there are people coming up with technical solutions to safeguard us, the first step is to raise awareness about the existence of this technology and how sophisticated it can be &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-other-example-a-deep-voice-baidus-real-time-neural-text-to-speech-system&#34;&gt;4. Other Example A: Deep Voice: Baidu&amp;rsquo;s Real Time Neural Text-to-Speech System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Google&amp;rsquo;s Tacotron and Wavenet, this paper&amp;rsquo;s authors from Baidu, a Google competitor, also elected to use neural networks and big data to train and implement every component of a TTS system, called Deep Voice. This further demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach of using big data to train deep neural networks. Baidu&amp;rsquo;s Deep Voice TTS system is consisted of five components, in their respective order they are: grapheme-to-phoneme model, segmentation model, phoneme duration model, fundamental frequency model, and audio synthesis model. The first grapheme-to-phoneme model is self explanatory, it is referred to as the &amp;ldquo;first component&amp;rdquo; of a TTS system in a two-component view. Grapheme-to-phoneme model converts text into phonemes. The second segmentation model is used to draw the boundaries between each phoneme (or each utterance) in the audio file given the audio file&amp;rsquo;s transcription. The third phoneme duration model predicts the time or duration of each phoneme. The forth fundamental frequency model predicts whether or not each phoneme is &amp;ldquo;silent&amp;rdquo;, as sometimes a part of a word is spelled but not voiced; if it is voiced, the model predicts its fundamental frequency. The fifth and final model, the audio synthesis model, combines the output of the prior four models and synthesize the final finished output audio. Baidu&amp;rsquo;s audio synthesis model is a modified version of DeepMind&amp;rsquo;s WaveNet &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All five models that compose Baidu&amp;rsquo;s Deep Voice are implemented with neural networks, making Deep Voice also an truly end to end &amp;ldquo;neural speech&amp;rdquo; synthesis model, also serving as a proof that the deep learning with big data approaches can be applied to every part and component of a TTS system. As to making it real time, the TTS system needs to be optimized to near instantaneous speeds. Baidu&amp;rsquo;s researchers experimented with various hyperparameter configurations, also including changing the amount of detail (and size) of the training data, data type, size/type of computational medium (CPU, GPU), amount of nonlinearities in the model, different memory cache techniques, and the overall size (computational requirements) of the models. They timed each of these configurations and scored the quality (MOS, Mean Opinion Scores) of each of their synthesized speech. The result shows a trade off between speech quality and synthesis speed. Without sacrificing too much audio quality, Deep Voice is able to produce a sufficient quality, 16 kHz audio, at 400 time faster that WaveNet and achieving the goal of making Deep Voice real-time or faster than real-time &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-other-example-b-siris-hybrid-mixture-density-network-based-approach-to-tts&#34;&gt;5. Other Example B: Siri&amp;rsquo;s Hybrid Mixture Density Network Based Approach to TTS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siri is Apple&amp;rsquo;s virtual assistant that is communicated through the use of natural language user interface, predominantly through speech. Siri is capable of perform user instructed actions, make recommendations, and more by delegating requests to other internet services. Apple&amp;rsquo;s three operating systems: iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, tvOS, and macOS all come with Siri. Siri was first released with iOS in iPhones in 2011, after Apple acquired it a year before. Within the components that make up Siri is a TTS system that is used to generate a spoken, verbal response to user&amp;rsquo;s input. Throughout the years, different techniques and technologies have been used to implement the TTS system of Siri in order to make it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old Siri uses predominantly a unit selection approach to its TTS system. Within predictable and narrow usage applications, older unit selection speech synthesis method still shines, because it can still produce adequately good speeches given that the system contains a very large amount of quality speech recordings. But the out performance of deep learning approaches over traditional methods had become more and more clear. Apple gave Siri a new and more natural voice by switching their old TTS system to one implement with a hybrid mixture density network based unit selection TTS system &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hybrid mixture density network based unit selection approach first uses a function to pick the most probable audio units for each speech segments, then uses a second function to find the most optimal (natural sounding) combination of the selected candidates for each broken down segment of the entire speech. The role of the mixture density network here in Siri is to serve as these two functions mentioned: a unified target model and concatenation model that is able to predict distributions of the target features of a speech and the cost of concatenation between the sample audio units. The function that models the distributions of target features used to be commonly implemented with hidden Markov models in a statistical parametric approaches of TTS. But it has since been replaced by the better deep learning approaches. The concatenation cost function is used to measure the acoustic difference between two units for the purpose of guaging their sound&amp;rsquo;s naturalness when concatenated. Hence the concatenation cost function is what is used during the search for the optimal sequence (or combinations) of units in the unit audio speech space &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in iOS 10 in 2017 until this moment, Siri&amp;rsquo;s TTS system had been upgraded with neural network approaches, and the new Siri&amp;rsquo;s voice is demonstrated to be massively preferred over the old one in controlled A/B testing &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-conclusion&#34;&gt;6. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tacotron, Deep Voice, and Siri&amp;rsquo;s TTS system are the three advance cutting edge TTS technologies. All of them are designed with deep neural networks as the main work horse with big data simultaneously acting as their food and their vitamins. With the knowledge of the history of TTS systems and its how its basic theoretical components, and through these three examples, we can see how big data and neural networks have revolutionized the speech synthesis technology field. Although, these advancements open potential dangers of it being used to exploit trust between people by the means of impersonation, they do provide us with even more real life benefits ranging from language translation to personal virtual assistants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction&#34;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of making machines talk has be around for many over 200 years. For example, in as early as 1779, a scientist called Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein built models of the human vocal tract (the cavity in human beings where voice is produced in) that can produce the sound of long vowels (a, e, i , o, u)&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. From then till the 1950s, there have been many successful studies and attempts to make physical models that mechanically imitate the human voice. In the late 1960s, the people trying to synthesize human voice started to do it electronically. In 1961, by utilizing the IBM 704 (one of the first mass produced computers), John Larry Kelly Jr and Louis Gerstman, made a voice recorder synthesizer (aka. vocoder). Their system was able to recreate the song &amp;quot;Daisy Bell&amp;quot;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Before the current deep neural network trend, modern systems for text-to-Speech (TTS) or speech synthesis has been dominated by concatenative methods and then statistical parametric methods. Creating the ability for humans to converse with computers or any machines is a one of those age-old dreams of humans. A human-computer interaction technology that provides the computers to comprehend raw human speech has been revolutionized in last couple of years by the amount of big data we have now and the implementation, mainly deep neural networks, that feeds on big data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Illustration of a typical TTS system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-overview-of-the-technology&#34;&gt;2. Overview of the Technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concatenative methods work by stringing together segments of prerecorded speech segments. The best of concatenative methods is the Unit Selection. The recorded voice segments in unit selection is categorized into individual phones, diphones, half-phones, morphemes, syllable, words, and phrases. Unit selection divides a sentence into segmented units by a speech recognizer, then these units are filled in with recorded voice segments based on parameters like frequency, duration, syllable position, as well as these parameters of its neighboring units &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The output of this system can be undistinguishable from natural voice, but only in very specific context that it is being tuned for and provided that the system has a very large database of speeches, usually in the range of dozens of hours of speech. This system suffers from boundary artifacts, which are unnatural connections between the sewed-together speech segments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What came after concatenative methods are the statistical parametric methods, it solved many of the concatenative method&amp;rsquo;s boundary artifact problems. Statistical Parametric methods are also called Hidden-Markov-Models-based (HHM-based) methods, because HMM are often the choice to model the probability distribution of speech parameters. The HH model selects the most likely speech parameters like frequency spectrum, fundamental frequency, and duration (prosody), given the word sequence and trained model parameters. Last, these speech parameters are combined to construct a final speech wave form. Statistical parametric synthesis can be described as /&amp;ldquo;generating the average of some sets of similarly sounding speech segment&amp;rdquo; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The advantage that statistical parametric methods have over concatenative methods is the ability to modify aspects of the speech such as the gender of speaker, or the emotion and emphasis of the speech. The use of statistical parametric methods marks the beginning of the transition from a knowledge-based system to a data-based system for speech synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a high-level point of view, a text-to-speech system is composed of two components. The first component starts with text normalization, also called preprocessing or tokenization. Text normalization converts symbols, numbers, and abbreviations into normal dictionary words. After text normalization, the first components end with text-to-phenome. Text-to-phenome is the process of dividing the text into units like words, phrases, and sentences; then converting these units into target phonetic representations, or target prosody (frequency contour, durations, etc.) The second component, often called the synthesizer or vocoder, takes the symbolic phonetic representations and converts them into the final sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-350/main/report/images/prosody.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Figure2&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Illustration of prosody&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-main-example-tacotron-1--2-and-wavenet-for-voice-synthesis&#34;&gt;3. Main Example: Tacotron 1 &amp;amp; 2 and WaveNet for Voice Synthesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tacotron a TTS system that begin by using a sequence to sequence architecture implemented with neural network to produce magnitude spectrograms with a given string of text. The first component of Tacotron is one single neural network that was trained from 24.6 hours of speech audio recorded by a professional female speaker. The effectiveness of a neural network in speech synthesis shows how big data approaches are improving and changing up the speech synthesis methodologies. Tacotron uses the Giffin-Lim algorithm for its second component, the vocoder. The authors note that their choice of approach for the second component is only used as a placeholder at that time, and they anticipated that the Tacotron is be more advanced with alternative approaches for the second component, the vocoder, in the future &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And Tacotron 2 is what the authors of the original Tacotron might have envisioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tacotron 2 is a TTS system built entirely using neural network architectures for both its first and second component. Tacotron 2 combines the original tacotron’s first component and combine it with Google’s WaveNet that serves as the second component. The tacotron-style first component responsible for preprocessing and text-to-phenome, produces mel spectrograms given the original text input. Mel spectrograms are representations of frequencies in mel scale as it varies over different time. The mel spectrograms are then fed into WaveNet, a vocoder that serves as the second component, which outputs the final sound &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WaveNet is a deep neural network model that can generate raw audio.  What is different about WaveNet is that it can model and generate the raw audio form. Typically, audio is digitized by sampling a single data point for every very small-time interval. A raw audio wave form typically contains 16,000 sample point in every second of audio. With that many sample points per second, an audio clip of a simple speech would contain millions and billions of data points. To make a generative model for these sample audio points, the model needs to be autoregressive, meaning every sample point generated by the model is influenced by its earlier sample points that is also generated by the model itself &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A very difficult challenge that DeepMind solved. Before DeepMind came up with WaveNet, they made pixelRNN and pixel CNN. Which proved that it is possible to generate a complicated image one pixel at a time given a large amount of quality training data. This time instead of an image generated a pixel at a time, an audio clip is generated one sample point at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WaveNet is trained with audio recordings, or wave forms, from real human speech. After training the model, WaveNet can generate synthetic utterances of human speech that does not actually mean anything. WaveNet would be fed a random audio sample point, and it will predict the next audio sample point and feed it back to itself and generating the next one, so on and so forth, producing complex realistic speech wave form. To apply WaveNet to TTS systems, it would have to be trained not only the human speech but also each training sample’s corresponding linguistic and phonetic features. This way, WaveNet would be conditioned on both the previous audio sample points and the words we want WaveNet to say. In a real working TTS system, these linguistic and phonetic features are the product of the first component, which is responsible for text-to-phenome &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;31-application-and-implications-of-a-lifelike-tts-system-like-tacotron-2&#34;&gt;3.1 Application and Implications of a lifelike TTS system like Tacotron 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The powerful and lifelike TTS system by Tacotron 2 and Wavenet enhances many real-life applications that relies on having a machine talk, but most predominantly in human-computer interaction like smart phone voice assistant. And naturally, with a TTS system so lifelike, there are some concerns it would be used for nefarious purposes; but it also enables great enhancements to current applications of TTS systems. In one example researchers are able to build system that adds a speech encoder system on top of Tacotron 2 and Wavenet, and make it so it would be able to clone anyone’s voice signature and produce any speech wave forms with that person’s voice with just a few seconds of his or her original speech recording &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The objective of the speaker encoder network added on to Tacotron 2 and Wavenet is to learn a high quality representation of a target speaker’s voice. In other words, the speaker encoder network is made to learn the &amp;ldquo;essence&amp;rdquo; and intricacies of human voices. The theory is that with this speech embeddings (representations) of a particular voice signature, Tacotron 2 and Wavenet would be able to use that to generate brand new speeches with the same voice signature. The most importance reason why this system is able to work with and extrapolate from an unseen and small amount of audio recording of the target speaker is a large and diverse amount of data of different speakers used to train the speaker encoder network &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This demonstrates that not only big data contributed to the success of this network but that the big data also has to be the right data, with &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; being having a diverse amount of different variations in speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible benefit of such a system can provide is in speech to speech translation across different languages. Because the system only requires couple seconds of un-transcribed reference audio recorded from the target speaker, this system can be used to enhance current, top of the line, speech to speech translation system like Google Translate by generating the output speech that is in another language with the original speaker’s voice. This makes the generated speech more natural and realistic sounding for the intended listener of the translated speech in a real world setting &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. An example of a fun implementation of such a system is the option to choose celebrity’s voices, like John Legend’s voice, as the voice of your Google Assistant in your smart phone or your Google Home &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But a different and potentially dangerous implication of a system being misused and abused is not hard to imagine as well, especially that sometimes the artificially synthesized speech by these latest TTS systems are rated as indistinguishable from real human speech &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. According to a study, our brain does not register significant differences between a morphed voice and a real voice &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, while we can still somewhat distinguish between a genuine and artificial voice, we probably will be fooled most of the time if we are not particularly paying attention and on the look out for it. For example, people can be fooled into believing or doing certain things, because the voice that they talked too belongs to someone who that trust or someone who they believe holds a certain type of authority. While there are people coming up with technical solutions to safeguard us, the first step is to raise awareness about the existence of this technology and how sophisticated it can be &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-other-example-a-deep-voice-baidus-real-time-neural-text-to-speech-system&#34;&gt;4. Other Example A: Deep Voice: Baidu&amp;rsquo;s Real Time Neural Text-to-Speech System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Google&amp;rsquo;s Tacotron and Wavenet, this paper&amp;rsquo;s authors from Baidu, a Google competitor, also elected to use neural networks and big data to train and implement every component of a TTS system, called Deep Voice. This further demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach of using big data to train deep neural networks. Baidu&amp;rsquo;s Deep Voice TTS system is consisted of five components, in their respective order they are: grapheme-to-phoneme model, segmentation model, phoneme duration model, fundamental frequency model, and audio synthesis model. The first grapheme-to-phoneme model is self explanatory, it is referred to as the &amp;ldquo;first component&amp;rdquo; of a TTS system in a two-component view. Grapheme-to-phoneme model converts text into phonemes. The second segmentation model is used to draw the boundaries between each phoneme (or each utterance) in the audio file given the audio file&amp;rsquo;s transcription. The third phoneme duration model predicts the time or duration of each phoneme. The forth fundamental frequency model predicts whether or not each phoneme is &amp;ldquo;silent&amp;rdquo;, as sometimes a part of a word is spelled but not voiced; if it is voiced, the model predicts its fundamental frequency. The fifth and final model, the audio synthesis model, combines the output of the prior four models and synthesize the final finished output audio. Baidu&amp;rsquo;s audio synthesis model is a modified version of DeepMind&amp;rsquo;s WaveNet &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All five models that compose Baidu&amp;rsquo;s Deep Voice are implemented with neural networks, making Deep Voice also an truly end to end &amp;ldquo;neural speech&amp;rdquo; synthesis model, also serving as a proof that the deep learning with big data approaches can be applied to every part and component of a TTS system. As to making it real time, the TTS system needs to be optimized to near instantaneous speeds. Baidu&amp;rsquo;s researchers experimented with various hyperparameter configurations, also including changing the amount of detail (and size) of the training data, data type, size/type of computational medium (CPU, GPU), amount of nonlinearities in the model, different memory cache techniques, and the overall size (computational requirements) of the models. They timed each of these configurations and scored the quality (MOS, Mean Opinion Scores) of each of their synthesized speech. The result shows a trade off between speech quality and synthesis speed. Without sacrificing too much audio quality, Deep Voice is able to produce a sufficient quality, 16 kHz audio, at 400 time faster that WaveNet and achieving the goal of making Deep Voice real-time or faster than real-time &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-other-example-b-siris-hybrid-mixture-density-network-based-approach-to-tts&#34;&gt;5. Other Example B: Siri&amp;rsquo;s Hybrid Mixture Density Network Based Approach to TTS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siri is Apple&amp;rsquo;s virtual assistant that is communicated through the use of natural language user interface, predominantly through speech. Siri is capable of perform user instructed actions, make recommendations, and more by delegating requests to other internet services. Apple&amp;rsquo;s three operating systems: iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, tvOS, and macOS all come with Siri. Siri was first released with iOS in iPhones in 2011, after Apple acquired it a year before. Within the components that make up Siri is a TTS system that is used to generate a spoken, verbal response to user&amp;rsquo;s input. Throughout the years, different techniques and technologies have been used to implement the TTS system of Siri in order to make it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old Siri uses predominantly a unit selection approach to its TTS system. Within predictable and narrow usage applications, older unit selection speech synthesis method still shines, because it can still produce adequately good speeches given that the system contains a very large amount of quality speech recordings. But the out performance of deep learning approaches over traditional methods had become more and more clear. Apple gave Siri a new and more natural voice by switching their old TTS system to one implement with a hybrid mixture density network based unit selection TTS system &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hybrid mixture density network based unit selection approach first uses a function to pick the most probable audio units for each speech segments, then uses a second function to find the most optimal (natural sounding) combination of the selected candidates for each broken down segment of the entire speech. The role of the mixture density network here in Siri is to serve as these two functions mentioned: a unified target model and concatenation model that is able to predict distributions of the target features of a speech and the cost of concatenation between the sample audio units. The function that models the distributions of target features used to be commonly implemented with hidden Markov models in a statistical parametric approaches of TTS. But it has since been replaced by the better deep learning approaches. The concatenation cost function is used to measure the acoustic difference between two units for the purpose of guaging their sound&amp;rsquo;s naturalness when concatenated. Hence the concatenation cost function is what is used during the search for the optimal sequence (or combinations) of units in the unit audio speech space &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in iOS 10 in 2017 until this moment, Siri&amp;rsquo;s TTS system had been upgraded with neural network approaches, and the new Siri&amp;rsquo;s voice is demonstrated to be massively preferred over the old one in controlled A/B testing &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-conclusion&#34;&gt;6. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tacotron, Deep Voice, and Siri&amp;rsquo;s TTS system are the three advance cutting edge TTS technologies. All of them are designed with deep neural networks as the main work horse with big data simultaneously acting as their food and their vitamins. With the knowledge of the history of TTS systems and its how its basic theoretical components, and through these three examples, we can see how big data and neural networks have revolutionized the speech synthesis technology field. Although, these advancements open potential dangers of it being used to exploit trust between people by the means of impersonation, they do provide us with even more real life benefits ranging from language translation to personal virtual assistants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weed identification is an important component of agriculture, and can affect the way farmers utilize herbicide. When unable to locate weeds in a large field, farmers are forced to blanket utilize herbicide for weed control. However, this method is bad for the environment, as the herbicide can leech into the water, and bad for the farmer, because they then must pay for far more fertilizer than they really need to control weeds. This project utilizes images from the Aarhus University [^1] dataset to train a CNN to identify images of 12 species of plants. To better simulate actual rows of crops, a subset of the images for testing will be arranged in a list representing a crop row, with weeds being distributed in known locations. Then, the AI is tested on the row, and should be able to determine where in the row the weeds are located.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction&#34;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a growing global population, and a changing climate that can make farm work hostile, it is increasingly important for farms to be efficient food producers. Fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides have allowed modern farms to produce far higher yields than they would otherwise be able to. However, the environmental impact from the runoff of these chemicals when they leave the farm can be incredibly detrimental to both human and natural wellbeing. This is why agriculture is a field that is ripe for improvement from AI. There are opportunities for AI to be used in the harvesting of crops, predictive analytics, and field monitoring. In this project, AI is used in the field monitoring application. This is helpful for farmers because spot detection of weeds will help them avoid using as much herbicide. This project will explore how pictures of plants can be used to detect weeds in crop fields. The AI has been trained with a CNN on pictures of 12 seedling species including 960 individual plants representing both weeds desired crops &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Although 12 species are available, only 3 will be studied in this project: black grass, shepherd’s purse, and sugar beet. These plants were chosen because their seedlings look different enough to give the AI a better chance at successfully detecting differences. Then, the AI is tested to determine the accuracy of the model. First this is accomplished by reserving a subset of the training data to be tested by the AI in order to get a base-line test of accuracy. Next, the test data will be arranged in a list to mimic a row of crops with a desired crop, and several weeds. Then the AI would go through the images and a program would display where a farmer would need to apply the herbicide, according to the AI. The true test would be to see if the program can produce a helpful map to narrow down where herbicide should be applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous similar work has been done with this dataset &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in Keras with CNN image recognition, while this project is implemented in pytorch. Similar agricultural image recognition with plant disease &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is also available to be studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-pre-processing-the-data&#34;&gt;2. Pre-Processing The Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant dataset &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; has three sets of image options to choose from. The first has large images of trays with multiple plants of the same species, the second has cropped images of individual seedings from
the larger picture (non-segmented), while the third is both cropped, and has the background replaced with black pixels such that only the leaves remain in the picture (segmented). To train the data,
the segmented data is used. This is because it is important for the AI to train such that it detects patterns only for the most important features of the image. If the AI were to train on the images in the
background, it might learn features of the sand or border instead of the leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next component to consider is the image size to be used. The CNN requires all images to be a uniform size to run correctly, while the original segmented data contains images of different sizes, ranging from a few 10s of pixels wide to over 4000. In order to get a sense a balance between having a broad enough dataset to have a large enough representation of the plant pictures to draw meaningful conclusions and the need to have reasonable file sizes, the image’s width or height, whichever is larger, was recorded and loaded into a histogram for each plant species. From a visual examination, 300x300 pixels was selected. An additional 100 pixels of padding were added to the final image size to prevent the images from being cut off when rotated. For each image in the segmented dataset, it is expanded to 400x400 pixels, and added to the straight image folder. Then, each image is rotated and versions are saved to a rotation folder. An ideal rotation would allow a fine grain of rotation. However, some resource limitations were met with the GPU used for the neural net. At first, the images were rotated by 10 degrees each before being saved, then 30, then 60, and finally 90. Finally, a csv file with ids and labels is needed to identify the images, and separate the training and the test data. A preprocessing python script can be used to achieve all of these goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-running-the-cnn&#34;&gt;3. Running the CNN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation of the CNN is heavily based upon the tutorial on MINST fashion identification &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; where the CNN identifies 28x28 pixel images of clothing. It is a 2 layer CNN implemented in pytorch. In the original neural net, there are 70000 of these small images and 9 clothing designations. In this dataset, there are only 3 types of labels, but much larger images. The tutorial had a train image set, a validation set, and a test set. After preprocessing, there were 420 suitable 400x400 unrotated images. Without any changes besides adjusting the file paths and image size parameters, the CNN could inconsistently get approximately 50 percent accuracy with the test data, with the highest accuracy at 15 epochs. Because this implementation has relatively few images compared to the MINST clothing dataset, the next test was to remove the validation set of images, in order to use more of the prepared images for training. The result was a maximum of 79 percent accuracy at 25 epochs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/sp21-599-354/raw/main/project/images/training_images.png&#34; alt=&#34;Figure 7&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3&lt;/strong&gt; Examples of prepared training images&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The testing accuracy of the neural net on the test data tracked closely with the prediction accuracy when train accuracy was around 30 to 50 percent, lagging by only a few percent. However, when the training dataset reached the 70 percent accuracy range, the test set accuracy remained at only around 50 percent. Part of this could be due to the small size of the test set, or the fact each plant species had a slightly different number of suitable test images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting observation is that although the model was able to consistently reach 60 percent accuracy, it would sometimes fall into a pattern where it would categorize all or almost all of the test set as just one of the plants. There was no consistency in which plant it defaulted to, but in between runs where the model reached decent accuracy, it would repeat this behavior. Because the test set was evenly distributed between the three plants, this would cause the accuracy to go to around 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to see if a visualization could help a human easily see where the hypothetical herbicide would need to be placed, a chart was created with tiles. The first row is the true layout of the three types of plants in the dataset, where each plant is assigned a color. The second row is the AI prediction of which type of plant the test set is. Even with the 79 percent test accuracy rate, it was not as clear as it could be from the image how accurate the model was. One way of making the visualization both easier to visually determine accuracy and more realistic is to have one type of plant be the dominant crop, and have patches of weeds throughout the row. The major obstacle to this was the fact that there were not enough suitable images to have a dominant plant in the test group. Too many images used in testing would have a detrimental impact on training the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/sp21-599-354/raw/main/project/images/visualization.png&#34; alt=&#34;Figure 8&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4&lt;/strong&gt; The top row 0 shows the actual species distribution of the plants, while the bottom row 1 shows the AI prediction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-benchmarking&#34;&gt;4. Benchmarking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longest operation by far was the first time reading in the images. This had a timed tqdm built in, so the stopwatch function was not used here. Subsequent running of the CNN training program must cache some of the results, so the image loading takes much less time. An initial loading of the 420 images took approximately 10 minutes. WIth the GPU accelarator enabled, the training of 25 epochs got to 6.809s while the test only took .015s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-possible-extension&#34;&gt;5. Possible Extension&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rotated images of the plants were ultimately not explored. This is due to the fact that the implementation that was followed required GPU resources on Google Colab. With only 420 images to feed into the model, the GPU was not strained. However, even with 90 degree rotations, it appeared that the GPU memory limit for running the entire notebook was reached before even the first epoch. If this project were to be attempted again, the images would either need to be smaller, or fewer straight images should be loaded so that their rotations would not exhaust GPU allocation. One way to go about this would be to have a rotation set with fewer images of individual plants, but to rotate them such that the rotated dataset is still around 420 images. Then, a comparison could be made between the training accuracy of 420 separate examples of each species vs fewer individual plants at a wider range of angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-conclusion&#34;&gt;6. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 420 non-rotated plant images, a maximum accuracy of 79 percent was able to be reached in part by using the entire training dataset for training rather than validation, as the project this was based on did. With a significantly smaller number of images for the neural net to train on, even a 10 percent change in the available training images mattered in its implementation. Another main conclusion is the importance of resource use and choice in running CNNs. Although in theory there could only be benefits to adding more images to train, with large enough datasets, practical computing limitations become increasingly apparent. Future work would involve choosing a model that either did not require GUP allocation, or modifying the chosen images to take fewer computing resources.&lt;/p&gt;
